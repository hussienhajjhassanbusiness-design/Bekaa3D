"""The setting key registry: what exists, what type it is, and what is allowed.

Two sources of truth would be a bug, so it is worth being precise about which
one this is. The **database holds the values**; this module holds everything
else - which keys exist, their declared type, their limits, their unit, and
whether they may be read by the public. A setting the registry does not declare
cannot be read, written, or created through the API, whatever rows happen to be
in the table (api-endpoints.md:632, "Clients cannot create arbitrary setting
keys in V1").

Putting the rules here rather than in the database is what BR-133 asks for in
reverse: the *values* must be operationally changeable without a deployment,
but the *rules* about them are logic, and logic belongs in the domain layer
under review. Widening a range is a code change with a test; changing a value
is a `PATCH`.

The numbers below are V1 product decisions. The SRS deliberately specifies none
of them - it says each is "configurable" and stops there - so they were taken
as explicit decisions rather than inferred, and the defaults are seeded by
migration so a fresh deployment is immediately operable.
