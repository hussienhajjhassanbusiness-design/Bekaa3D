"""Reading settings from other bounded contexts.

Ordering, Engagement and the background jobs all need setting values, and none
of them may query the `settings` table directly - cross-context access goes
through a service interface, which is what keeps this a modular monolith rather
than a shared database (CLAUDE.md, architecture rules).

The reader takes the caller's `AsyncSession` rather than opening its own. That
matters for correctness, not tidiness: FR-18 requires checkout to "recheck the
accepting-orders setting inside its transaction", which is only meaningful if
the read happens on the same connection and therefore the same snapshot as the
work it guards.
