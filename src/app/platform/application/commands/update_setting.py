class UpdateSetting:
    """Change one typed setting, atomically with its audit row.

    The concurrency requirement (FR-18) is that two administrators editing the
    same setting produce "deterministic conflict or last-commit behavior with
    both attempts audited". This implements last-commit, serialised on the row:

        SELECT ... FOR UPDATE  ->  validate  ->  capture current  ->  update
                               ->  audit     ->  commit

    Taking the lock *first* is what makes the audit trail honest. The second
    administrator blocks until the first commits, then re-reads and sees the
    first one's value as its own "before" - so a race produces `10 -> 20` then
    `20 -> 30`, not two rows both claiming they changed 10. Without the lock
    both would read 10 and the audit log would describe a history that never
    happened.

    Holding the lock across validation is deliberate and cheap: validation is
    pure in-memory type and range checking, microseconds, with no hashing or
    I/O. (Login had to move Argon2 *outside* its lock for exactly the opposite
    reason.)

    Optimistic locking with a version column and a 409 was the alternative the
    requirement also permits. It was rejected because it needs a column the
    frozen schema does not have and a conflict code the error catalogue does not
    define, to solve a contention problem that does not exist on a 12-row table
    edited by one or two administrators.
