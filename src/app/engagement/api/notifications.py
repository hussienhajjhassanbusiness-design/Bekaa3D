    `current_user` rather than the narrower `current_claims`, and the difference
    is a security one rather than a convenience. `current_claims` re-reads
    `users.auth_epoch` per ADR-018, which catches a password reset - but nothing
    bumps the epoch when an account is merely *deactivated*, so a claims-only
    dependency would keep serving a disabled account its own notifications for
    the remainder of the access token's fifteen minutes. `current_user` re-reads
    the row and re-checks `can_authenticate` (`is_active`, `anonymized_at`,
    `deleted_at`).

    That is the same reasoning VS-006 applied to `GET /me`, and notifications are
    the same kind of data: personal, and sitting under the same `/me` prefix. The
    cost is the duplicate primary-key read already recorded as a performance
    follow-up in CLAUDE.md, which is the right price for the two sibling
