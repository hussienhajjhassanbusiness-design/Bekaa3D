    """arq job: sends due, pending outbox emails. Scheduled every minute (SRS 23).

    Each message gets its own transaction. Sending inside a transaction is
    unavoidable - the provider call and the status write have to be tied
    together somehow - so a commit that fails after a successful send will
    re-deliver that message on the next tick. That at-least-once window is
    inherent and is not claimed to be closed here.

    What a per-message transaction does remove is the amplification: with the
    whole batch under one transaction, one failed commit rolled back up to
    BATCH_SIZE already-delivered messages and re-sent every one of them. The
    blast radius is now a single message.

    Concurrency safety still comes from the repository's SELECT ... FOR UPDATE
    SKIP LOCKED claim, which is unchanged - two workers still take disjoint
    messages, they just hold one row lock at a time instead of twenty.
