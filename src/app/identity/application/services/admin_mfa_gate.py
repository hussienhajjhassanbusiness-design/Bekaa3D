"""VS-005: the only question VS-003's login asks about MFA.

Login has to know whether an account must prove a second factor before it is
given a session. It must not know *how* MFA works. This module is that
boundary: `AdminMfaGate.challenge_required` is the entire MFA surface that
`identity/application/commands/login.py` can see, and everything behind it -
credentials, TOTP, recovery codes, challenges, ciphertext - stays in VS-005.

Keeping the gate in its own VS-005 file rather than inlining the check inside
login.py is deliberate. It is what lets a reader months from now separate
VS-003's original login implementation from the VS-005 integration added to
it: in login.py the integration is one constructor argument and one branch,
and every line of MFA reasoning lives here."""

    would be safe to hand back to the caller. The route converts it into an
    opaque, short-lived challenge id, which is what `202 MfaChallengeRead`
    actually returns (api-endpoints.md:252).

    The epoch travels with it because the challenge has to be stamped with the
    value read under login's row lock, not one re-read afterwards - a reset
    landing in between would otherwise mint a challenge that looks current

          confirmed is an abandoned or in-progress setup, not a working second

          (`/auth/mfa/setup`, `/setup/confirm`) need the very session the
