"""Per-session MFA state, and the short-lived login challenge that establishes it.

Why Redis rather than Postgres. `sessions` (database-design.md 5.3) has no MFA
column and the frozen entity inventory adds no `mfa_challenges` table, so both
of these would mean deviating from the approved schema. They are also exactly
what Redis expiry is for: the completion flag dies with the session and the
challenge dies in minutes. This follows the precedent LoginThrottle already set
for the SEC-05 counters.

Two distinct pieces of state live here, and the difference matters:

- **The login challenge** is *pre-authentication*. It is created by
  `POST /auth/login` when an administrator's password is right but their second
  factor is still outstanding (api-endpoints.md:252). At that moment there is
  no session, so the challenge is bound to the **user**. It is the only thing
  standing between the caller and a session, which is why it is random,
  single-use and short-lived.
- **The completion flag** is *post-authentication* session state, keyed by
  session id. It records that a session was born MFA-complete so the claim
  survives refresh rotation.

Neither is a source of truth about whether an account has MFA enabled -
`mfa_credentials.enabled_at` is."""
