"""Progressive delay and lockout on repeated login failure (SEC-05).

State lives in Redis, not Postgres. The frozen `users` table has no
failed-attempt columns and database-design.md never adds any, so counting in
the database would mean deviating from the frozen schema - and a counter that
resets on success is exactly what Redis expiry is for.

V1 design assumption: SEC-05 mandates "progressive delay and lockout" but the
SRS specifies no thresholds, so these numbers are chosen here (same convention
as the VS-002 rate limits in identity/api/auth.py) and documented as such."""
