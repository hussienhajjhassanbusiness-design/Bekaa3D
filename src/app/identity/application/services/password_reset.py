"""Issuing password-reset tokens and deciding when a new one is allowed.

Deliberately parallel to services/verification.py rather than shared with it.
The two flows look alike but authorise different things - a verification token
proves control of a mailbox, a reset token replaces a credential - and folding
them into one helper would make it easy to give them one lifetime, one cooldown
and eventually one token table."""
