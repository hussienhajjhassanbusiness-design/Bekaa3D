"""Administrator activation/deactivation of an account (VS-009, F-116).

The only mutation `PATCH /api/v1/admin/users/{user_id}` performs. It is small,
but it is the one admin operation that revokes somebody else's access, so the
ordering below is deliberate rather than incidental.

Why deactivation also ends sessions and bumps the epoch
-------------------------------------------------------
`require_admin` and `current_claims` authorise from the signed access token plus
one scalar read of `users.auth_epoch` (ADR-018). Neither re-reads `is_active`.
Clearing the column alone would therefore leave the deactivated account's
current access token working for the remainder of its fifteen minutes - and for
an administrator that includes the very endpoint that could turn the account
back on. Advancing the epoch closes that window immediately, and revoking the
session rows stops refresh from minting a replacement.

Nothing in the SRS requires this: SEC-08 mandates revocation on *password
change* only, and no document states what deactivation does to a live session.
This is a V1 decision recorded here and in the slice's PR rather than a
requirement being implemented.
