    Two checks, in this order. The signature and standard claims first, so a
    forged or expired token is refused with no database traffic at all and an
    unauthenticated caller cannot use this path to generate load. Then one
    indexed scalar read of `users.auth_epoch`: the token records the epoch it
    was minted under, and this refuses it once the account has moved past that.

    This is the part of ADR-006 that ADR-018 supersedes. ADR-006 traded
    revocation latency for a database-free authenticated path, and the trade was
    reasonable until VS-004 made immediate revocation a security requirement:
    without this read a password reset left every access token it had just
    revoked working for the remainder of its fifteen minutes.

    The epoch is read from PostgreSQL rather than a cache. It is the authority
    for an authentication decision, and a cache that answers *successfully* with
    a lost key - a restarted Redis, an evicted entry, a restored snapshot -
    would silently re-validate revoked credentials. That failure looks like
    normal operation, which is exactly what makes it unacceptable.

    a challenge is `POST /auth/login` (api-endpoints.md:252), so an

    is fixed by a step-up:

    - they have not finished enrolling, and need `/auth/mfa/setup` +
      `/setup/confirm`, which this very session is already entitled to call;
    - they hold a session predating the moment MFA was enabled on the account,
      and need to log in again to be challenged.

    Minting a challenge here would be a second, session-bound way to reach an
    MFA-complete session - exactly the parallel authentication path the slice
    is meant not to have.

    MFA state is read from the signed token rather than from Redis, keeping
    ADR-006's "no database round-trip on an ordinary authenticated request"
    property. A session created through `/auth/mfa/verify` is born with the
    claim set, and refresh carries it across rotation, so the claim cannot lag
