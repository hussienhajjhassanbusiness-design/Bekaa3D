"""The public reference lists are rate limited, and say so the standard way.

api-endpoints.md lists `429` as the only error these three endpoints can return,
so the limiter is part of their contract rather than optional hardening.

The policy is asserted from `PUBLIC_RATE_LIMIT` rather than from a number copied
into this file. That matters: 600/hour is a V1 operational decision that may well
be revised, and a test hardcoding it would have to be edited alongside the policy
- and would silently stop proving anything if the two drifted.
