"""Regressions for three review findings on VS-005.

Each test here fails against the branch as originally written:

- an accepted TOTP could be presented a second time inside its ~90-second
  window (RFC 6238 5.2);
- `/auth/mfa/setup/confirm` could be replayed against an already-enabled
  credential, rotating the recovery-code set without the password that
  `/auth/mfa/recovery-codes/regenerate` demands;
- reaching the MFA challenge with a correct administrator password wrote no
  audit row at all (BR-132).
