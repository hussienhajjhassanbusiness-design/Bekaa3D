"""What a password reset does, and does not, do to an administrator's MFA.

SEC-08 says a reset ends every pre-reset authentication state. VS-005 added a
second kind of that state which VS-004 was written before: the five-minute login
challenge issued once an administrator's password checks out. It lives in Redis
rather than in `sessions`, so revoking rows cannot reach it, and a challenge
minted with the old password would otherwise still be redeemable into a fresh
session afterwards.

The other half of the requirement is a preservation rule, and it matters just as
much: enrollment, the TOTP secret and the recovery codes must all survive. A
reset proves control of the mailbox, which is precisely what the second factor
exists to be independent of - clearing it would turn a mailbox compromise into a
full account takeover.
