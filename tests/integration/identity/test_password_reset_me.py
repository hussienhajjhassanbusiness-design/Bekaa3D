"""VS-006 `/api/v1/me` across a password reset.

Two halves of one guarantee. Authentication issued *before* a reset must stop
working the moment the reset completes - not at the next refresh - and
authentication issued *after* it must work normally. The second half is what
stops the first from being satisfied by simply breaking `/me`.

Before ADR-018 the first half was false: `current_claims` trusted the signed
access token for its full fifteen minutes and never consulted the `sessions`
row, so a revoked session kept reading `/me` until the token happened to expire.
