"""A TOTP time-step must be spendable exactly once, even under a dead heat.

`MfaCredential.record_totp_step` uses `max()`, but that only orders values
already inside one process's memory. Two transactions that both read the same
stale `last_totp_step` would both conclude the step was unspent and both accept
the code - one intercepted OTP, two admin sessions. What actually serialises
them is the `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` in
`MfaCredentialRepository.get_by_user_id_for_update`, and that can only be
proven against real PostgreSQL with two concurrent transactions.

Each coroutine below opens its own session and its own transaction, which is
the same shape `get_session` gives a real request - two independent MFA
challenges arriving at the same instant.

    This is the instrument the test needs, and it is worth being precise about
    why. The window being tested is exactly read -> decide -> write; a race
    only demonstrates anything if both transactions are inside it at once.
    Bare `asyncio.gather` does not achieve that - the coroutines usually run one
    to completion before the other starts - and neither does a barrier placed
    *before* the read, because `asyncio.Barrier` lets the last arriver continue
    without yielding, so it can finish its whole transaction first. Either way
    the test passes against unlocked code, which makes it decorative.

    So the sync point goes immediately after the read. The timeout is what
    makes that safe in both directions:

    - **Unlocked:** both racers complete their read, both reach the barrier,
      both are released, and both then write from stale data. The race is real
      and the test fails, as it must.
    - **Locked:** the second racer is still blocked inside PostgreSQL on
      `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` and never arrives. The first waits, times out,
      proceeds, and commits; the lock releases; the second finally reads the
      advanced row and correctly refuses the code.

    Without the timeout the locked case would deadlock on a barrier that can
    never fill."""
