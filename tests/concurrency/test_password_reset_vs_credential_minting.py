"""A password reset racing the other two paths that mint credentials.

`test_password_reset_vs_mfa_challenge.py` covers MFA completion. These are the
other two, and the invariant is the same one stated three ways:

> No authentication operation that started from a pre-reset credential may
> emerge after the reset carrying the post-reset `auth_epoch`.

For **login**, the pre-reset credential is the old password. For **refresh**, it
is a refresh token belonging to a session the reset is about to revoke.

Both are serialised against the reset by the same mechanism: a
`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` on the `users` row, taken *before* anything is decided.
The lock order is `users` then `sessions` everywhere, which is why refresh had
to be restructured - VS-003 locked the session row first and never touched the
user row, and adding a user lock after it would have closed a deadlock cycle
against the reset's user-then-sessions order.

Synchronisation is deterministic, not `asyncio.gather` and hope: the racers are
released from a barrier placed immediately after the contended read, which is
the shape VS-005 arrived at after two earlier versions passed against code with
no lock at all.

    after the barrier the reset spends ~80ms inside Argon2 before it revokes,
