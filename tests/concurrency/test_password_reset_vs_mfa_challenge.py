"""A password reset racing the redemption of a challenge issued before it.

The postcondition is one sentence: once a reset has returned successfully, no
challenge issued before it can result in a usable session. Sequentially that is
easy - the epoch check refuses the challenge. Concurrently there are two
orderings, and the requirement is that *both* end in the same place:

- **Reset commits first.** The challenge redemption must be refused outright.
- **Redemption commits first.** It may legitimately create a session - it got
  there before the reset did - but the reset must then find that session and
  revoke it. A reset that returns 204 while a session it did not know about is
  still live has not done what SEC-08 asks.

What must never happen is the third ordering: the redemption inserting its
session *after* the reset's revocation UPDATE has already run. That leaves a
live session minted from a pre-reset challenge, which is the exact hole this
file exists to keep closed.

Both operations take a `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` on the user row
(`UserRepository.get_by_id_for_update`), which is what removes that third
ordering: neither can interleave with the other. The lock is a database
mechanism, so this is an integration test against real PostgreSQL - a mock
would assert nothing about it.

On the synchronisation: bare `asyncio.gather` does not reliably produce a race
(one coroutine usually runs to completion before the other starts), so the
racers are released from a barrier *inside* their transactions and immediately
before the contended read. That is the lesson from VS-005's TOTP replay work,
where two successive versions of a concurrency test went green against code
that had no lock at all.

    inside Argon2 before it reaches `revoke_all_for_user`, while the redeemer
    reaches its INSERT almost immediately. Left to run, the redeemer therefore
    commits first in *both* the locked and the unlocked build, the revocation
    sweeps up its session either way, and the test passes against code with no
    lock at all - decorative, in exactly the way VS-005's first two concurrency
    tests were.

    Waiting for the revocation inverts that. The dangerous ordering becomes the
    one the unlocked build actually takes, and the lock is the only thing that
    can prevent it:

    - **Unlocked:** the reset is not blocked, so it bumps the epoch and revokes
      while no session exists yet, then sets the event. The redeemer - which
      passed its epoch check *before* waiting - wakes up and inserts a session
      nothing will ever revoke. `live == 1`, and the test fails.
    - **Locked:** one of the two holds the user row and the other cannot reach
      this point at all, so the wait times out harmlessly and the orderings
      collapse to the two safe ones.
