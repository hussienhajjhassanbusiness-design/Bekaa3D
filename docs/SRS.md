# PART A — BUSINESS

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

Bekaa3D is a **dual-commerce platform** for a Lebanese 3D-printing business. It
serves two distinct commercial models through one system:

| Half                       | What it sells                       | How it transacts                                |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **A — Physical catalogue** | 3D-printed products, made on demand | Per product: online checkout, WhatsApp, or both |
| **B — STL marketplace**    | Digital model files                 | Online checkout only, instant delivery          |

### 1.2 Business Context

The business operates in Lebanon, where commerce remains substantially
relationship-based and cash-oriented. The platform's defining design decision —
**per-product purchase mode** — exists to respect this: products can be sold
through a modern online checkout, through a human WhatsApp conversation, or
both, at the administrator's discretion per item.

This is also the system's accessibility safeguard. Customers without a Whish
balance or card are never locked out; they use WhatsApp.

### 1.3 Scope of Version 1

**In scope:**

* English-language public storefront with SEO
* Physical product catalogue with three purchase modes
* STL digital marketplace with permanent downloads
* Cart supporting mixed digital + physical orders
* Online payment via Whish
* Manual fulfillment workflow (delivery and workshop pickup)
* Offer/negotiation system for STL products
* Reviews, wishlist, notifications
* Bring Your Idea lead workflow
* Admin dashboard with analytics
* Refunds with per-line partial support

**Explicitly out of scope for V1:**

* Product variants (colour/material selection at purchase) — routed to WhatsApp
* International shipping — routed to WhatsApp for quotation
* Courier API integration — fulfillment is manual
* Cash on delivery
* Guest checkout — account required for all purchases
* Product comments (distinct from reviews) — deferred
* BYI online payment — lead workflow only
* STL licensing management
* Mobile applications
* Tax/VAT calculation

### 1.4 Success Criteria

1. A customer can discover, evaluate, and purchase an STL file, then download it permanently.
2. A customer can order a physical product online and track it to delivery or pickup.
3. A customer can reach the business via WhatsApp for anything the platform doesn't transact.
4. The administrator can operate the entire business from the dashboard without database access.
5. Both languages are fully usable, including right-to-left layout.
6. No payment can be granted without independent server-side verification.

## 2. Actors & Roles

### 2.1 Actor Catalogue

| Actor                        | Authenticated            | Capabilities                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Visitor**                  | No                       | Browse catalogue, view products/reviews, search, submit Bring Your Idea, submit contact message, initiate WhatsApp contact               |
| **Registered (unverified)**  | Yes                      | Everything a Visitor can do. **Cannot perform any write action.**                                                                        |
| **Customer (verified)**      | Yes                      | All purchasing, cart, checkout, downloads, offers, reviews, wishlist, order management, self-cancellation, data export, account deletion |
| **Administrator**            | Yes                      | Full catalogue, order, fulfillment, refund, offer, moderation, settings, and analytics control                                           |
| **System**                   | —                        | Scheduled jobs, projections, notifications, expiry, reconciliation                                                                       |
| **Payment Provider (Whish)** | External                 | Payment processing, webhook callbacks, status queries                                                                                    |
| **Courier**                  | External, outside system | Physical delivery. **Not a system user** — no tracking integration in V1                                                                 |

### 2.2 The Verification Boundary

**Browsing is open. Acting requires a verified email.**

| Action class                                      | Requirement                            |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| View catalogue, product, reviews, search          | None                                   |
| Submit Bring Your Idea, contact form              | Captcha + rate limit (guest permitted) |
| Cart, checkout, download, offer, review, wishlist | Verified account                       |
| All admin functions                               | Admin role + (recommended) MFA         |

### 2.3 Future Roles

The role model is built extensibly from day one. V1 has a single administrator;
the architecture supports Super Admin, Manager, and Content Editor without
refactoring.

## 3. Business Rules Register

Every rule is numbered for traceability. `BR-` prefix.

### 3.1 Products

| ID     | Rule                                                                                                                        |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| BR-001 | Each physical product has exactly one purchase mode: Online Only, WhatsApp Only, or Both.                                   |
| BR-002 | Purchase mode is changeable by the admin at any time.                                                                       |
| BR-003 | WhatsApp Only products bypass cart and checkout entirely.                                                                   |
| BR-004 | Purchase mode is re-validated at checkout; lines whose product changed mode are rejected.                                   |
| BR-005 | Physical products have no stock quantity — they are manufactured on demand.                                                 |
| BR-006 | Each physical product declares a production lead time in days.                                                              |
| BR-007 | Each physical product declares a maximum quantity per order line.                                                           |
| BR-008 | Each physical product declares a batch size (units producible per lead-time cycle).                                         |
| BR-009 | A product may be marked temporarily unavailable; its page stays live for SEO but add-to-cart is disabled.                   |
| BR-010 | Colour, material, and dimension variations are **not** selectable at purchase; customers requiring variations use WhatsApp. |
| BR-011 | Categories, materials, and colours are admin-managed controlled lists, never free text.                                     |
| BR-012 | Only main categories exist; no subcategories in V1.                                                                         |
| BR-013 | A category cannot be deleted while products are assigned to it; the admin must reassign first.                              |
| BR-014 | STL products are uploaded by the administrator only (single-vendor marketplace).                                            |
| BR-015 | An STL product may contain multiple files (a bundle).                                                                       |
| BR-016 | STL products are versioned; all files in a version supersede together.                                                      |
| BR-017 | Product name is required.                                                                                                   |
| BR-018 | Nothing is ever hard-deleted; all entities use soft delete.                                                                 |

### 3.2 Cart

| ID     | Rule                                                                                                           |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| BR-020 | One cart per registered customer, persisting across sessions.                                                  |
| BR-021 | A cart may contain both STL and physical products simultaneously.                                              |
| BR-022 | A cart holds at most one line per product; adding an existing product merges quantities.                       |
| BR-023 | STL lines always have quantity exactly 1.                                                                      |
| BR-024 | Physical line quantity may not exceed the product's maximum per line.                                          |
| BR-025 | An STL the customer already owns cannot be added or purchased again.                                           |
| BR-026 | Cart lines snapshot the price at the time of adding; a changed price is surfaced for confirmation at checkout. |
| BR-027 | Delivery address and shipping fee are required only when the cart contains at least one physical line.         |

### 3.3 Checkout & Orders

| ID     | Rule                                                                                                                               |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| BR-030 | Checkout requires a verified account. There is no guest checkout.                                                                  |
| BR-031 | All prices, shipping, and totals are recomputed server-side; client-supplied amounts are never trusted.                            |
| BR-032 | Each order carries a human-readable order number.                                                                                  |
| BR-033 | Order lines snapshot product name (both languages), price, and image at purchase; later catalogue edits never alter order history. |
| BR-034 | An order's fulfillment method is Delivery, Pickup, or none (digital-only orders).                                                  |
| BR-035 | Order status is a derived projection of payment status and line statuses; it is never set directly.                                |
| BR-036 | Each order line carries its own fulfillment status.                                                                                |
| BR-037 | Estimated dispatch date = max across physical lines of (lead time × ceil(quantity ÷ batch size)).                                  |
| BR-038 | Customers are promised an estimated **dispatch** date, never a delivery date; courier transit is outside the company's control.    |
| BR-039 | Unpaid checkouts expire after a configurable hold period and are cancelled automatically.                                          |
| BR-040 | The global "accepting orders" kill switch blocks new checkouts but never affects payments already in flight.                       |
| BR-041 | Checkout is idempotent; a repeated request with the same idempotency key returns the original order.                               |
| BR-042 | Digital lines are fulfilled instantly on payment verification, independently of physical lines.                                    |

### 3.4 Payments

| ID     | Rule                                                                                                                          |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| BR-050 | All prices are in USD.                                                                                                        |
| BR-051 | Money is stored as integer cents with an explicit currency code; floats are never used.                                       |
| BR-052 | Whish is the sole payment provider in V1, behind a provider abstraction.                                                      |
| BR-053 | A payment callback is a notification, never proof of payment.                                                                 |
| BR-054 | Payment is confirmed only by independent server-side verification (status query or, failing that, manual admin confirmation). |
| BR-055 | The confirmed amount must match the order total; a lesser amount is never treated as paid.                                    |
| BR-056 | Duplicate webhook deliveries are idempotent and never double-grant.                                                           |
| BR-057 | Nothing is granted or produced before confirmed payment — no entitlement, no manufacturing.                                   |
| BR-058 | At most one live payment attempt may exist per order; a retry is permitted only after the prior attempt fails or expires.     |
| BR-059 | No tax is applied in V1; the price shown is the price charged.                                                                |

### 3.5 Refunds & Cancellation

| ID     | Rule                                                                                                                             |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| BR-060 | STL purchases are final; this is presented and consent is recorded at checkout.                                                  |
| BR-061 | Physical orders are refundable at the administrator's discretion, on a published baseline policy.                                |
| BR-062 | Refunds may be partial and per-line, including shipping.                                                                         |
| BR-063 | Every refund creates a tracked obligation record that remains pending until settled.                                             |
| BR-064 | A refunded digital line revokes the entitlement; future downloads are blocked.                                                   |
| BR-065 | Revocation cannot recall already-downloaded files; the protections are the consent record, download logs, and access revocation. |
| BR-066 | A customer may cancel their own order while it is paid but not yet in production.                                                |
| BR-067 | Once a line enters production, self-cancellation closes and cancellation becomes an admin decision.                              |
| BR-068 | STL lines are never self-cancellable.                                                                                            |
| BR-069 | A customer whose entitlement was revoked may purchase the product again.                                                         |

### 3.6 Shipping & Fulfillment

| ID     | Rule                                                                           |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| BR-070 | Shipping uses admin-managed zones with flat rates.                             |
| BR-071 | Only Lebanese zones are enabled in V1.                                         |
| BR-072 | International customers are directed to WhatsApp for a quotation.              |
| BR-073 | Workshop pickup is offered, is free, and requires no address.                  |
| BR-074 | Shipping fee and zone are snapshotted onto the order.                          |
| BR-075 | Fulfillment is entirely manual; no courier integration exists in V1.           |
| BR-076 | An optional free-shipping threshold may be configured.                         |
| BR-077 | A returned item is not terminal; it may be re-shipped, reprinted, or refunded. |

### 3.7 Offers

| ID     | Rule                                                                                                        |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| BR-080 | Offers apply to STL products only, never physical products.                                                 |
| BR-081 | A customer may have only one live offer per STL product at a time.                                          |
| BR-082 | Counter-offers are unlimited in number.                                                                     |
| BR-083 | Each round resets an inactivity deadline for whoever's turn it is.                                          |
| BR-084 | An offer auto-expires if the party whose turn it is fails to respond in time.                               |
| BR-085 | Acceptance snapshots the agreed price, which is immutable thereafter.                                       |
| BR-086 | Acceptance issues a one-time checkout scoped to that customer and product, valid for a configurable window. |
| BR-087 | Once accepted, the inactivity timer is void; only the checkout window applies.                              |
| BR-088 | Acquiring the product by any other route automatically closes a live offer.                                 |
| BR-089 | Rejection starts a cooldown before the customer may open a new offer on that product.                       |
| BR-090 | Offers below a configurable percentage of list price are rejected at submission.                            |
| BR-091 | The complete negotiation history is preserved permanently.                                                  |
| BR-092 | A customer may withdraw their own pending offer.                                                            |

| BR-100 | Any verified user may review any product; a purchase is not required.                     |
| BR-101 | One review per user per product, editable but not stackable.                              |
| BR-102 | Reviews backed by a real purchase display a Verified Purchase badge.                      |
| BR-103 | WhatsApp-only products can never earn the badge, as no purchase record exists.            |
| BR-104 | The badge is recomputed when an entitlement is granted or revoked.                        |
| BR-105 | Ratings are 1–5 integers.                                                                 |

| BR-107 | Reviews are rate-limited and filtered for links and profanity.                            |
| BR-108 | Wishlist is available to verified users; the admin sees totals and most-wishlisted items. |
| BR-109 | Product comments (separate from reviews) are not implemented in V1.                       |

| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| BR-110 | Bring Your Idea accepts guest submissions, protected by captcha and rate limiting.       |
| BR-111 | Reference images are validated, re-encoded, scanned, and stored privately (admin-only).  |
| BR-112 | The workflow is a lead pipeline; it does not transact.                                   |
| BR-113 | Statuses: New → Contacted → Quoted → In Progress → Completed → Closed, with a Lost exit. |
| BR-114 | The admin may record a quoted amount and won/lost outcome for funnel reporting.          |
| BR-115 | Reference images expire and are purged after a retention period.                         |
| BR-116 | The contact form follows the same guest + captcha + rate-limit pattern.                  |

| BR-125 | Account deletion anonymises rather than purges; financial and download records are retained. |
| BR-126 | Deletion is blocked while orders are open or refunds unsettled.                              |

4. Adds to cart, or submits an offer if negotiating.
5. Proceeds to checkout — no address required for a digital-only order.
6. Accepts terms including all-sales-final for digital goods.
7. Redirected to Whish, completes payment.
8. System independently verifies the payment.
9. Entitlement granted; confirmation email and notification sent.
10. Downloads the file from the account library, unlimited thereafter.

### 5.2 Purchase a Physical Product Online

1. Visitor browses the physical catalogue.
2. Opens a product configured Online Only or Both.
3. Sees price, production lead time, and estimated dispatch.
4. Registers and verifies, adds to cart with quantity within the cap.
5. At checkout chooses delivery (with address and zone fee) or free workshop pickup.
6. Server recomputes all totals; customer accepts terms.
7. Pays via Whish; system verifies independently.
8. Order enters the admin queue.
9. Admin marks in production → ready → shipped or ready for pickup.
10. Customer receives status emails and notifications throughout.
11. Admin marks delivered or picked up; order completes.

### 5.3 Order via WhatsApp

1. Visitor opens a product configured WhatsApp Only or Both.
2. Taps Contact via WhatsApp; a prefilled message identifies the product.
3. All negotiation, pricing, payment, and delivery happen off-platform.
4. No order record is created; the business handles it manually.

### 5.4 Negotiate an STL Price

1. Verified customer submits an offer above the minimum floor.
2. Admin receives it in the offers queue.
3. Admin accepts, rejects, or counters. Unlimited rounds; each resets the deadline.
4. On acceptance the price is frozen and a one-time checkout is issued.
5. Customer pays within the checkout window.
6. Entitlement granted; the offer closes as paid.
7. If rejected, a cooldown must elapse before a new offer.

### 5.5 Request Custom Printing

1. Visitor (guest permitted) completes the Bring Your Idea form.
2. Uploads reference images; captcha and rate limits apply.
3. Request enters the admin pipeline as New.
4. Admin contacts the customer, records a quoted amount, marks Quoted.
5. All commercial agreement happens off-platform.
6. Admin advances to In Progress, Completed, Closed, or marks Lost.

### 5.6 Mixed Order with Partial Refund

1. Customer's cart contains one STL file and one physical product.
2. Single payment covers both; delivery address required for the physical line.
3. On verification: STL entitlement granted instantly; physical line enters production.
4. A printer failure makes the physical item unproducible.
5. Admin cancels that line and issues a partial refund covering it and shipping.
6. The STL entitlement is unaffected and remains active.
7. Order status becomes Partially Refunded; the refund is tracked until settled.

# PART B — FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATION

## 6. Catalogue & Search

### 6.1 Product Attributes

**Common to both types:** name*, description*, category, price, multiple images, visibility flag, featured flag, SEO metadata* (title, description, OG image, slug). Fields marked * are per-language.

**Physical only:** purchase mode, material, colour, dimensions, production lead time (days), batch size, maximum quantity per line, availability toggle, weight (optional, reserved for future weight-based shipping).

**STL only:** file bundle, file sizes, current version.

**Derived:** average rating, review count, download count (STL).

### 6.2 Type Integrity

The database enforces that an STL product carries no physical-only fields and a physical product carries all required physical fields. This prevents, for example, an STL row acquiring a production lead time and corrupting the dispatch calculation.

### 6.3 Search

**Requirement:** full-text search with typo tolerance, over product names and descriptions.

Snowball stemming via the built-in `english` text-search configuration. Trigram indexes provide typo tolerance and power autocomplete.

Query strategy: full-text match first; fall back to trigram similarity when results are thin.

### 6.4 Filtering & Sorting

**Facets:** category, material, colour, price range, minimum rating, product type. Facets AND together and combine with search.

Because materials and colours are controlled reference lists rather than free text, facet values group correctly — free text would produce "PLA", "pla", and "PLA plastic" as three distinct filters.

**Sorts:** price ascending/descending, rating, newest, most downloaded (STL).

**Pagination:** cursor-based for stable ordering under concurrent inserts.

### 6.5 Visibility

Storefront queries return only products that are non-deleted, visible, and belong to an active category. Unavailable products remain visible and indexable but cannot be added to cart — this preserves SEO value during a temporary stop-sell.

---

## 7. Cart & Checkout

### 7.1 Cart Behaviour

One persistent cart per customer. Adding a product already in the cart merges quantities rather than creating a second line — without this, a per-line quantity cap is trivially bypassed by adding the same product twice.

| Line type | Quantity            | Constraint                               |
| --------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| STL       | Always 1            | Rejected if already owned                |
| Physical  | 1..max_qty_per_line | Rejected if unavailable or WhatsApp-only |

### 7.2 Price Snapshots

Cart lines record the price when added. At checkout, current prices are compared; any change is surfaced to the customer for explicit confirmation before payment. This prevents both silent overcharging and stale-price disputes.

### 7.3 Checkout Validation Sequence

Executed inside a single transaction:

1. Verify the idempotency key; return the prior response if this is a replay.
2. Check the global kill switch — if orders are paused, reject with 503.
3. Lock the cart.
4. Validate every line: product exists, not deleted, visible, available, purchase mode permits online sale.
5. Re-verify STL ownership; silently drop anything acquired since adding.
6. Validate quantities against current caps.
7. Determine fulfillment method; require address for delivery.
8. Resolve the shipping zone and rate; apply free-shipping threshold if configured.
9. **Recompute all totals server-side.**
10. Create order, order items with snapshots, and a pending payment.
11. Compute the estimated dispatch date.
12. Clear the cart.
13. Record terms consent with timestamp.

### 7.4 Conditional Requirements

| Cart contents      | Address      | Shipping fee | Fulfillment method |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------------ |
| STL only           | Not required | None         | None (null)        |
| Physical, delivery | Required     | Zone rate    | Delivery           |
| Physical, pickup   | Not required | Free         | Pickup             |
| Mixed, delivery    | Required     | Zone rate    | Delivery           |
| Mixed, pickup      | Not required | Free         | Pickup             |

### 7.5 Idempotency

Checkout requires an `Idempotency-Key` header. A repeated key with a matching request body returns the stored response; a mismatched body returns 409. This is what prevents a double-clicked checkout from creating two orders and two payment attempts.

---

## 8. Orders & Fulfillment

### 8.1 Order Composition

An order carries: order number, customer, source (cart or offer), derived status, fulfillment method, monetary breakdown (subtotal, shipping, tax=0, total, currency), address snapshot, shipping zone and rate snapshot, customer note, internal admin note, estimated dispatch date, and lifecycle timestamps.

Each line carries: product reference, type, name snapshot (both languages), image snapshot, unit price, quantity, line total, its own fulfillment status, lead time and batch size snapshots, and an optional offer reference.

### 8.2 Why Per-Line Status

A mixed order can have its physical half cancelled while the digital half remains valid. A single order-level status cannot express this. Per-line status is therefore mandatory, and the order header status is computed from the lines.

### 8.3 Delivery Workflow

`pending` → `in_production` → `ready_to_ship` → `shipped` → `delivered`

Exits: cancellation before production (customer or admin) or during production (admin only, creating a refund obligation). From `shipped`, a failed delivery moves to `returned`, which may then be re-shipped, reprinted, or refunded. From `delivered`, an upheld claim moves to `refunded`.

### 8.4 Pickup Workflow

`pending` → `in_production` → `ready_for_pickup` → `picked_up`

Payment has already occurred online, so no money changes hands at handover. The workshop address and hours are configurable settings displayed at checkout and in the ready-for-pickup notification.

### 8.5 The Cancellation Cutoff

Entering production is the boundary. Before it, the customer may self-cancel. After it, cancellation requires admin action because material and machine time have been committed.

This transition and a customer self-cancellation contend for the same row lock, so exactly one wins — the race cannot leave the order in an ambiguous state.

### 8.6 Dispatch Estimation

`dispatch_days = max over physical lines of (lead_time_days × ceil(quantity ÷ batch_size))`

Batch size matters: if one print takes six hours and four fit on the bed, ten units is three cycles, not ten. A naive `max(lead_time)` would systematically understate multi-unit orders — precisely the orders where a missed date causes the most damage.

### 8.7 Admin Capabilities

View and filter the queue; inspect customer and order detail; transition line statuses; add internal notes (never customer-visible); cancel lines or orders; issue refunds; view the pending-refund obligations queue.

---

## 9. Payments & Refunds

### 9.1 Provider Abstraction

All payment interaction sits behind a provider interface: create payment, query status, issue refund (where supported), verify webhook signature (where supported). Whish is the first adapter; a mock adapter enables full development and testing without credentials. Additional providers require no changes outside their adapter.

### 9.2 Verification — the Critical Path

**Governing rule: a callback is a notification, never proof.**

The webhook endpoint is public. If it were trusted, a forged callback would yield free digital files and free manufactured goods. The verification sequence is therefore:

1. **Receive and persist** the webhook event immediately. A unique constraint on (provider, event id) makes duplicate delivery harmless — this is the idempotency mechanism.
2. **Return 200 quickly.** Providers retry on timeout; slow processing multiplies deliveries.
3. **Verify the signature** if the provider offers one. Failure rejects and alerts.
4. **Independently query** the provider for transaction status, holding no database locks.
5. **Confirm the amount matches** the order total exactly. A lesser amount is never treated as paid.
6. **Apply the result** in a second transaction: mark paid, grant digital entitlements, move physical lines to production, close any live offer, recompute the order projection, write audit and history, enqueue emails.

If the provider offers no status query, the event is queued for **manual admin confirmation** against the provider dashboard. Slower, but a forged callback still yields nothing.

### 9.3 Missed Callbacks

A scheduled reconciliation job queries the provider for any payment stuck in processing beyond a threshold. Without it, a lost callback leaves a customer charged with nothing delivered and no recovery path — the single worst failure mode in the system.

### 9.4 One Live Payment Per Order

A database constraint permits only one payment in pending, processing, or paid state per order. A retry requires the prior attempt to have failed or expired, which is what the checkout-release job provides.

### 9.5 Refund Policy

| Product type | Policy                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| STL          | All sales final. Consent recorded at checkout with timestamp.                                                                                                                   |
| Physical     | Admin discretion on a published baseline: full refund before production; damaged, wrong, or undelivered resolved by replacement or refund with evidence within a stated window. |

### 9.6 Refund Execution

Refunds may cover any subset of lines plus shipping. Each creates a refund record with amount, currency, reason, requester, approver, method, and settlement state. Digital lines in a refund revoke their entitlement.

The record remains a **tracked pending obligation** until settled. If the provider has no refund API, settlement is a manual transfer — exactly the kind of task that gets forgotten without a queue driving it.

### 9.7 Chargeback Handling

A confirmed reversal revokes the entitlement and audits the event. Already-downloaded bytes cannot be recalled; the mitigations are the recorded consent, the download log as evidence, and blocked future access.

---

## 10. Digital Assets & Downloads

### 10.1 Storage

STL master files reside in a private directory on the application server, never within any web-served path. Filenames are server-generated UUIDs — the original filename is stored in the database but never used on disk, defeating both path traversal and guessing.

All storage access goes through an abstraction, so migration to S3-compatible object storage is a configuration change rather than a rewrite.

### 10.2 Versioning

An STL product has one current version; each version contains one or more files. Versions supersede atomically — a bundle must never serve files from two versions at once. Superseded files are retained permanently, never deleted. Entitlement holders always receive the current version.

### 10.3 Entitlements

Entitlement is a first-class entity and the **sole authority** for download access. It is granted by purchase, accepted offer, or admin grant; revoked by refund or chargeback.

A database constraint permits at most one **active** entitlement per (customer, product). Because it covers only active rows, a customer whose entitlement was revoked may legitimately purchase again.

### 10.4 Download Serving

The application must never stream file bytes itself — streaming large binaries through the async application process blocks the event loop and degrades every concurrent request.

Sequence:

1. Authenticate the customer.
2. Verify an active entitlement for the product.
3. Check the daily download cap.
4. Write the download log entry.
5. Return an `X-Accel-Redirect` header pointing at the internal path.
6. The reverse proxy streams the file with `sendfile`, supporting HTTP Range for resumption.

The internal location is unreachable directly from the internet.

### 10.5 Download Logging

Every download records customer, entitlement, file, start and completion timestamps, bytes sent, salted IP hash, user agent, and whether it was a resumption.

The table is monthly-partitioned. Detail rows are pruned after a retention period; monthly aggregates are retained indefinitely and are what dashboard queries read, so "most downloaded" never scans raw partitions.

**IP hashing** uses a rotating salt. The IPv4 space is small enough that unsalted hashes are trivially reversible — the salt is mandatory, and rotation makes historical hashes unlinkable.

### 10.6 Abuse Controls

Downloads are unlimited by promise, but a configurable per-day cap guards against credential sharing and bandwidth exhaustion. The cap is set high enough that legitimate customers never encounter it.

---

## 11. Offers & Negotiation

### 11.1 Scope

Offers apply exclusively to STL products. Physical products are not negotiable through the system; those conversations happen on WhatsApp.

### 11.2 Turn-Based Model

An offer always has a `turn` (admin or customer) and a `responds_by` deadline for that turn. Each counter switches the turn and resets the deadline. Failure to respond expires the offer — this is the backstop that prevents indefinitely open negotiations.

### 11.3 Acceptance

Acceptance freezes the agreed price permanently, even if the list price later changes. A one-time checkout is issued, scoped to that customer and product, valid for a configurable window.

**Timer precedence:** once accepted, the inactivity timer is void; only the checkout window applies. Collapsing the two would expire an offer the customer is actively paying for.

### 11.4 Concurrency Safeguards

A database constraint permits one live offer per (customer, product) across the awaiting and accepted states — an application check loses this race under concurrent submissions.

If the customer acquires the product by any other route, any live offer auto-closes. This prevents both a double charge and an orphaned offer.

### 11.5 Anti-Abuse

A minimum offer floor, expressed as a percentage of list price, is enforced at submission. Rejection starts a cooldown before a new offer on the same product; each subsequent rejection re-arms it. Offer submission is rate-limited.

### 11.6 History

Every round is an append-only record: sequence, actor, action, amount, message, timestamp. The complete negotiation history is preserved permanently and is visible to both parties.

---

## 12. Reviews, Wishlist & Engagement

### 12.1 Review Model

Any verified user may review any product without purchasing. This is a deliberate decision that accepts some fake-review risk in exchange for review volume, mitigated by guardrails rather than by gating.

**Guardrails:** one review per user per product (editable), Verified Purchase badge where a real entitlement or physical order exists, admin hide/restore, rate limiting, link and profanity filtering.

The badge is **recomputed** on entitlement grant and revocation — a cached flag written once would leave a refunded buyer displaying credibility they no longer hold.

WhatsApp-only products can never earn the badge, since no purchase record exists. This is a known and accepted bias.

### 12.2 Rating Aggregates

Average rating and review count are maintained aggregates on the product, recalculated on review creation, edit, deletion, and moderation. Computing them on demand across a growing table would not survive catalogue growth.

### 12.3 Wishlist

Verified users add and remove products. The admin sees total wishlist counts and most-wishlisted products, informing promotion decisions. Price-drop alerts are deferred to a future version.

### 12.4 Notifications

An in-app notification centre complements email. Types include offer updates, purchase confirmation, download availability, order status changes, and account events. Each carries a type, JSON payload, and read state.

---

## 13. Bring Your Idea & Contact

### 13.1 Purpose

Bring Your Idea is the primary lead channel for custom printing — the business's highest-value work. It is deliberately a **lead workflow, not a transaction**: custom jobs require conversation about feasibility, material, and dimensions, so an automated quote-and-pay flow would wrap a process that must happen by hand anyway.

### 13.2 Submission

Guest submission is permitted. Requiring registration would suppress exactly the casual enquiries this channel exists to capture.

**Fields:** name, email, phone, project title, description, preferred material, preferred colour, dimensions, reference images.

**Protections:** captcha, per-IP and per-email rate limiting, file type validation by content inspection (not extension), size and count caps, image re-encoding to strip embedded payloads, malware scanning, private storage.

### 13.3 Pipeline

`new` → `contacted` → `quoted` → `in_progress` → `completed` → `closed`, with a `lost` exit from contacted or quoted.

The admin records a **quoted amount** and **won/lost outcome**. These are admin-only and exist solely so the business can measure conversion on its main lead channel — without them, the funnel is invisible.

### 13.4 Attachment Retention

Reference images carry an expiry and are purged from both disk and database by a scheduled job.

### 13.5 Contact Form

Same guest-plus-captcha pattern. Messages enter an admin queue with statuses new, read, replied, archived.

---

## 14. Identity & Accounts

### 14.1 Registration

Email and password only. Every additional field costs conversion, and the account requirement already imposes friction.

### 14.2 Verification Gate

Registration creates an unverified account that may browse but perform **no write action**. This is the system's primary anti-abuse control and applies uniformly to cart, checkout, download, offer, review, and wishlist.

Consequence: email delivery is critical-path infrastructure. A verification email that does not arrive locks the user out of the entire product. This mandates a reputable transactional provider, correct SPF/DKIM, an outbox with retry, delivery monitoring, and a resend flow.

Accounts never verified are purged after a configurable period.

### 14.3 Authentication

Passwords hashed with Argon2id. Tokens delivered as httpOnly, Secure, SameSite cookies — not accessible to JavaScript, which eliminates token theft via XSS. Access tokens are short-lived; refresh tokens rotate on use and are stored hashed. CSRF protection applies to all unsafe methods.

### 14.4 Addresses

Multiple saved addresses with a default. Fields: label, recipient name, phone, governorate, city, area, street, and **landmark notes** — Lebanese addressing is landmark-based, so free-text notes are functionally required rather than decorative.

### 14.5 Data Rights

**Export:** JSON containing profile, addresses, orders, downloads, reviews, and offers.

**Deletion:** implemented as anonymisation. Login is disabled and personal data stripped, but financial and download records are retained in anonymised form — required for accounting and referential integrity. Deletion is blocked while orders are open or refunds unsettled, since fulfilling an order requires the name and address.

---

## 15. Admin Dashboard

### 15.1 Catalogue Management

Product CRUD for both types; image upload, reorder, and cover selection; category, material, and colour management; visibility, featured, and availability toggles; SEO metadata; STL version upload and supersession.

### 15.2 Order Management

Filterable queue by status, date, customer, and fulfillment method; order detail with customer information; per-line status transitions; internal notes; cancellation; refund issuance.

### 15.3 Queues

Bring Your Idea pipeline; contact messages; pending offers; pending refund obligations; payments requiring manual confirmation; review moderation.

### 15.4 Settings

Typed, admin-editable configuration with audit trail. At minimum: accepting-orders kill switch, offer response window, offer checkout window, rejection cooldown, minimum offer percentage, checkout hold period, unverified purge period, daily download cap, free-shipping threshold, pickup address and hours, WhatsApp number.

These are settings rather than constants specifically so operational changes never require a deployment.

### 15.5 Analytics

**Revenue must be attributed per line item**, not per order — a mixed order would otherwise corrupt the STL revenue figure the business relies on.

Reports: revenue by stream, recent purchases, customer statistics, top rated products, most wishlisted, most downloaded, download statistics, pending offers, Bring Your Idea funnel conversion.

There is no inventory dashboard, as products are made on demand.

## 16. Notifications

### 16.1 Email Catalogue

| Trigger                     | Recipient |
| --------------------------- | --------- |

| Order confirmation          | Customer  |
| Payment receipt             | Customer  |
| STL download availability   | Customer  |
| Order in production         | Customer  |
| Order shipped               | Customer  |
| Ready for pickup            | Customer  |
| Order delivered / picked up | Customer  |
| Order cancelled             | Customer  |
| Refund issued               | Customer  |
| Offer countered             | Customer  |
| Offer accepted              | Customer  |
| Offer rejected              | Customer  |
| Offer expiring soon         | Customer  |

WhatsApp-only orders generate no system email — those conversations happen entirely off-platform.

### 16.2 Delivery Architecture

Emails are written to an **outbox table inside the business transaction** and delivered afterwards by a worker. This guarantees that a transient email failure can never roll back a payment, and that a queued message is never silently lost. Retry uses exponential backoff with a failure alert threshold.

---

## 17. SEO

### 17.1 Coverage

English only, across navigation, static pages, product names and descriptions, categories, materials, colours, emails, error messages, and SEO metadata.

### 17.2 Storage Model

Product, category, material, and colour text lives in plain columns on their owning tables — no separate translation tables. This keeps slug uniqueness enforceable by a single index and keeps search indexing straightforward.

### 17.3 URL Strategy

Slugs are unique among non-deleted rows.

A soft-deleted product must release its slug, otherwise a deleted product holds its URL forever and the admin can never reuse it.

### 17.4 SEO Requirements

Meta title and description, Open Graph image, canonical URLs, an XML sitemap, and structured data for products and reviews.

| Containerisation            | Docker Compose                                |

### 18.2 Architectural Style

Clean Architecture with layered separation: **domain** (entities, invariants, pure logic), **application** (use cases, orchestration), **infrastructure** (repositories, external adapters), **api** (routers, schemas).

Dependencies point inward only. Domain has no framework or database imports.

### 18.3 Bounded Contexts

| Context        | Owns                                                                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Identity       | Users, addresses, sessions, tokens                                  |
| Catalog        | Products, categories, materials, colours, images                    |
| Digital Assets | Asset versions, STL files, entitlements, download log               |
| Ordering       | Cart, orders, order items, status history                           |
| Payments       | Payment attempts, webhook events, refunds                           |
| Fulfillment    | Shipping zones, fulfillment transitions                             |
| Negotiation    | Offers, offer rounds                                                |
| Engagement     | Reviews, wishlist, notifications, custom requests, contact messages |
| Platform       | Settings, audit log, email outbox, idempotency records              |

Cross-context access goes through service interfaces. Direct joins into another context's tables are prohibited — that practice is what turns "Clean Architecture" into folder decoration.

### 18.4 Key Abstractions

| Abstraction              | Purpose                                               |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Payment provider port    | Whish today, any provider later, mock for development |
| Storage port             | Local filesystem today, S3-compatible later           |
| Email provider port      | Provider-agnostic transactional delivery              |
| Captcha port             | Provider-agnostic verification                        |
| Repository per aggregate | Persistence isolated from domain logic                |

**Entitlement**

* INV-04 — Download access derives exclusively from an active entitlement.
* INV-05 — Entitlement creation is atomic with payment verification.
* INV-06 — Revocation never deletes; it sets a revocation timestamp.

**Ordering**

* INV-07 — Lines whose product is WhatsApp-only, invisible, unavailable, or deleted are rejected at checkout.
* INV-08 — STL lines have quantity exactly 1 and are rejected when an active entitlement exists.
* INV-09 — A cart holds at most one line per product; merged quantity respects the cap.
* INV-10 — The kill switch blocks new checkouts but never in-flight payments.
* INV-11 — Dispatch estimate accounts for quantity and batch size.

**Content**

* INV-12 — Product name is required.
* INV-13 — Slugs are unique among non-deleted rows.

**Security**

* INV-14 — Every write action requires a verified email.
* INV-15 — Every fetch by ID verifies ownership or admin role.
* INV-16 — STL masters are never served from a public path.

**Consistency**

* INV-17 — Verified Purchase badges recompute on entitlement grant and revocation.
* INV-18 — At most one active entitlement per (customer, product); revoked holders may re-purchase.
* INV-19 — At most one live payment per order.
* INV-20 — Order status is a projection, never assigned directly.

## 20. State Machines

### 20.1 Payment

```
pending ──> processing ──> paid ──> partially_refunded ──> refunded
   │             │           └────────────────────────────> refunded
   │             ├──> failed
   └──> expired  └──> expired
```

`paid` is reachable only through independent server-side verification.

### 20.2 Order Status (derived projection)

```
payment pending or processing        → pending_payment
payment failed or expired            → cancelled
payment paid:
    all lines cancelled              → cancelled
    all lines refunded               → refunded
    any refund present               → partially_refunded
    no physical lines                → completed
    all physical lines terminal      → completed
    otherwise                        → in_progress
```

Recomputed within the same transaction as any payment or line change.

### 20.3 Order Line — Digital

```
pending ──> granted ──> revoked
```

Granted atomically with payment verification.

### 20.4 Order Line — Physical (Delivery)

```
pending ──> in_production ──> ready_to_ship ──> shipped ──> delivered ──> refunded
   │             │                    ↑            │
   └─> cancelled └─> cancelled        └── returned ┘
                                          └──> in_production (reprint)
                                          └──> refunded
```

`returned` is deliberately not terminal.

### 20.5 Order Line — Physical (Pickup)

```
pending ──> in_production ──> ready_for_pickup ──> picked_up ──> refunded
```

### 20.6 Offer

```
                  ┌──> rejected (sets cooldown)
awaiting_admin ───┼──> accepted ──> paid
   ↑    │         └──> expired         └──> checkout_expired
   │    └──> awaiting_customer ──┐     └──> auto_closed
   └───────────────────────────  ┤
                                 ├──> withdrawn
                                 └──> expired
```

Once accepted, only the checkout window applies.

### 20.7 Custom Request

```
new ──> contacted ──> quoted ──> in_progress ──> completed ──> closed
            └──> lost   └──> lost

| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Primary keys | UUID (time-ordered where available)                                                                                |
| Timestamps   | `timestamptz`, UTC always. Never naive — Lebanon observes DST, and naive datetimes shift every expiry twice a year |
| Money        | `bigint` cents plus `char(3)` currency, with non-negative checks                                                   |
| Soft delete  | `deleted_at` nullable; uniqueness via partial indexes                                                              |
| Enums        | Native PostgreSQL enum types                                                                                       |

**Extensions:** pgcrypto, citext, pg_trgm, unaccent, btree_gin.

### 21.2 Invariants Enforced in the Database

Application checks provide good error messages; **database constraints provide the guarantee**. Under concurrency, application checks lose races that indexes do not.

| Constraint                                        | Enforces                 |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Unique active entitlement per (user, product)     | INV-18                   |
| Unique live payment per order                     | INV-19                   |
| Unique live offer per (user, product)             | Offer concurrency        |
| Unique (cart, product)                            | INV-09                   |
| Unique current asset version per product          | Atomic bundle versioning |
| Unique review per (user, product) among live rows | BR-101                   |
| Unique email among live users                     | Account integrity        |
| Unique slug among live rows                       | INV-13                   |
| Unique (provider, event id) on webhooks           | Webhook idempotency      |
| Product type field check                          | Type integrity           |
| STL line quantity = 1                             | INV-08                   |
| Delivery requires address                         | Fulfillability           |
| Rating between 1 and 5                            | BR-105                   |
| Non-negative money on every monetary column       | INV-01                   |

### 21.3 Indexing Strategy

Catalogue indexes are **partial**, filtered on non-deleted and visible rows — the only rows the storefront queries. This keeps them small and cache-resident.

| Index                                           | Serves                       |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| (type, category, price) partial                 | Catalogue browse             |
| (type, material, colour, price) partial         | Facet filtering              |
| rating descending, partial                      | Top-rated sorting            |
| created descending, partial                     | Newest sorting               |
| GIN on search vector                            | Full-text search             |
| GIN trigram on name                             | Typo tolerance, autocomplete |
| (user, placed) on orders                        | Customer order history       |
| (status, placed) on orders                      | Admin queue                  |
| (fulfillment status, order) partial physical    | Fulfillment queue            |
| (user) partial active entitlements              | Download authorisation       |
| (status, responds_by) on offers                 | Expiry job                   |
| (send_after) partial pending outbox             | Email dispatch               |
| (status, initiated) partial processing payments | Reconciliation job           |
| (created) partial pending refunds               | Obligations queue            |

### 21.4 Partitioning & Retention

| Table     | Strategy                 | Retention                                         |
| --------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| downloads | Monthly range partitions | Detail 24 months; monthly aggregates indefinitely |
| audit_log | Monthly range partitions | 24 months hot, then archived                      |

Partitions are created three months ahead by a scheduled job. **If partitions run out, inserts fail and downloads stop working** — this job must never be disabled.

### 21.5 Search Implementation

A generated `tsvector` column uses the `english` text-search configuration. Names are weighted above descriptions.

## 22. API Contract

### 22.1 Conventions

| Concern        | Standard                                                    |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Base path      | `/api/v1` — versioned from day one                          |
| Authentication | httpOnly, Secure, SameSite cookies                          |
| CSRF           | Double-submit token on unsafe methods                       |
| Errors         | RFC 9457 `application/problem+json`                         |
| Pagination     | Cursor-based with `next_cursor`                             |
| Sorting        | Comma-separated field list with `-` prefix for descending   |
| Idempotency    | `Idempotency-Key` header on checkout and refunds            |
| Rate limits    | Standard `RateLimit-*` response headers                     |
| Money in JSON  | `{"amount_cents": int, "currency": string}` — never a float |

### 22.2 Error Contract

Every error carries a **stable machine-readable code**. The client renders its own message from the code, never from the human-readable detail. Changing a code value is a breaking API change.

### 22.3 Status Code Matrix

| Condition                                  | Status | Code                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Malformed body                             | 400    | MALFORMED_REQUEST                                              |

| Not owner or not admin                     | 404    | NOT_FOUND (deliberately not 403 — avoids confirming existence) |
| Already owned                              | 409    | PRODUCT_ALREADY_OWNED                                          |
| Live offer exists                          | 409    | OFFER_ALREADY_ACTIVE                                           |

| Orders paused                              | 503    | ORDERS_PAUSED                                                  |

### 22.4 Endpoint Groups

**Public:** products list and detail, reviews, categories, materials, colours, search suggestions, custom requests, contact messages, public settings.

**Authentication:** register, login, logout, refresh, verify email, resend verification, password reset request and confirm.

**Customer:** profile, addresses, entitlements, orders, order cancellation, downloads, download history, cart operations, checkout, offers (create, counter, accept, withdraw, checkout), wishlist, reviews, notifications, data export, account deletion.

**Admin:** product CRUD, image management, asset versions, categories, materials, colours, shipping zones, order queue and transitions, refunds, offer management, custom request pipeline, contact messages, review moderation, settings, analytics, payment reconciliation.

**Webhook:** payment provider callback — public, IP-allowlisted, signature-verified where available.

Admin routes are mounted on a separate router with separate authentication and rate limits. Sharing a namespace with public routes is how authorization mistakes happen.

## 23. Background Jobs

| Job                         | Cadence | Purpose and consequence of absence                                                                                                                           |
| --------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `dispatch_outbox`           | 1 min   | Delivers queued email with backoff. Without it, verification emails are lost and users are locked out entirely.                                              |
| `expire_offers`             | 5 min   | Expires offers whose turn deadline passed. Without it, negotiations never close.                                                                             |
| `release_stale_checkouts`   | 5 min   | Cancels unpaid orders past hold. Without it, the one-live-payment constraint permanently blocks retry.                                                       |
| `reconcile_payments`        | 15 min  | Queries the provider for stuck payments. **Most important job in the system** — without it a lost callback leaves a customer charged with nothing delivered. |
| `purge_unverified_users`    | Daily   | Removes never-verified accounts.                                                                                                                             |
| `purge_expired_attachments` | Daily   | Deletes expired reference images from disk and database.                                                                                                     |
| `reap_orphan_files`         | Daily   | Reconciles filesystem against database. Filesystem writes are not transactional with Postgres, so orphans occur.                                             |
| `backup_verify`             | Daily   | Confirms backup integrity. A silently failing backup looks identical to a working one until the day it matters.                                              |
| `ensure_partitions`         | Monthly | Creates partitions three months ahead. If they run out, downloads stop.                                                                                      |
| `prune_download_details`    | Monthly | Rolls detail into aggregates, drops old partitions.                                                                                                          |
| `rotate_ip_salt`            | Monthly | Makes historical IP hashes unlinkable.                                                                                                                       |

## 24. Infrastructure & Deployment

### 24.1 Services

nginx (TLS, static assets, protected file streaming, first-line rate limiting), api (multiple workers), worker (job consumer), scheduler (cron), postgres, redis, clamav.

### 24.2 Volumes

`pgdata`, `stl_private` (never web-served; read-only to nginx), `uploads_private`, `media_public`, `backups`.

### 24.3 Protected File Serving

nginx serves the STL directory as an `internal` location, unreachable directly from the internet. Only an `X-Accel-Redirect` header emitted by the API after entitlement verification can trigger it. The API authorises; the web server transfers.

### 24.4 Secrets

Never committed. Environment file with restricted permissions or Docker secrets. Required: database URL, Redis URL, JWT signing key, CSRF secret, IP hash salt, Whish channel and secret, webhook IP allowlist, email provider key, captcha secret, Sentry DSN, backup repository URL and encryption key.

**The backup encryption key must also be stored off the server.** An encrypted backup whose only key lives on the failed host is not a backup.

### 24.5 Backups

| Asset                   | Method                             | Cadence              | Target                    |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------- |
| PostgreSQL              | Full plus continuous WAL archiving | Nightly + continuous | Off-server, S3-compatible |
| STL masters and uploads | Incremental snapshot               | Daily and on upload  | Off-server, encrypted     |
| Verification            | Automated integrity check          | Daily                | Alerts on failure         |
| Restore drill           | Manual, documented                 | Quarterly            | —                         |

**Recovery objectives:** RPO ≤5 minutes for database, ≤24 hours for files. RTO ≤4 hours, documented in a runbook.

### 24.6 Monitoring

Error tracking, uptime monitoring, **cron liveness monitoring** (alerts when a job stops running — the failure mode silent monitoring misses), host metrics, and business alerts for payments stuck in processing, outbox backlog, and disk above 80%.

Disk alerting is mandatory: STL masters, uploads, logs, and WAL share one volume, and a full disk corrupts PostgreSQL.

### 24.7 CI/CD

Lint, type check, test, migration reversibility check, image build, deployment with health-check gating and one-command rollback. A staging environment is required — payment webhooks cannot be safely developed against production.

## 27. Testing Strategy

| Layer            | Scope                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Unit**         | State machine transitions including illegal edges, money arithmetic, dispatch estimation                                                                                 |
| **Integration**  | Real PostgreSQL. **Every constraint asserted by attempting to violate it.** A mock or SQLite asserts nothing, because the invariants live in partial indexes and checks |
| **Contract**     | Payment adapter against a mock implementing every verification branch, including the no-status-API worst case                                                           |
| **End-to-end**   | Cart checkout through payment, entitlement, and download; offer through acceptance, one-time checkout, and payment; mixed order through partial refund and revocation   |
| **Concurrency**  | Parallel double-checkout, duplicate webhooks, self-cancel racing production start, concurrent offer submission                                                          |
| **Security**     | IDOR sweep across every identified route, unverified-email write attempts, download without entitlement, price tampering                                                |

**Mandatory coverage:** the mixed-order partial-refund path, identified in audit as the most bug-prone area in the system.

## 28. Build Phases

| Phase                 | Contents                                                                                                    | Blocked by Whish? |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **0 — Foundation**    | Migrations, auth, verification, i18n, admin shell, catalogue CRUD, search, settings, outbox, jobs           | No                |
| **1 — Storefront**    | Public catalogue, product pages, reviews, wishlist, notifications, Bring Your Idea, contact, WhatsApp paths | No                |
| **2 — Commerce**      | Cart, checkout, orders, fulfillment workflow, shipping zones, pickup, refunds — against mock provider       | No                |
| **3 — Digital**       | Asset versions, entitlements, downloads, offers                                                             | No                |
| **4 — Payments live** | Whish adapter, webhook, verification, reconciliation, manual confirmation                                   | **Yes**           |
| **5 — Hardening**     | Rate limits, captcha, scanning, MFA, monitoring, backup drill, data rights, load test                       | No                |

Phases 0–3 and 5 are fully unblocked. Only Phase 4 requires merchant credentials, and its interface is fixed by the adapter contract, making it a swap rather than a rewrite.

## 29. Risk Register

| #  | Severity     | Risk                                                                                    | Mitigation                                                                                      |
| -- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1  | **Critical** | Whish onboarding incomplete; gates all revenue on both halves                           | Apply immediately via the Whish app; develop against mock; phase delivery                       |
| 2  | **Critical** | Webhook authenticity unresolved — a forged callback would yield free goods              | Always re-query the provider server-side; never trust callback payload; idempotency by event ID |
| 3  | **High**     | Refund mechanism unknown; manual refunds get forgotten                                  | Confirm during onboarding; system tracks obligations until settled                              |
| 4  | **High**     | Prepaid plus made-on-demand — money held for goods that do not yet exist                | Lead times, quantity caps, availability toggle, kill switch, fast refund path                   |
| 5  | **High**     | Single host is a single point of failure for application, database, and purchased files | Tested off-server backups; storage abstraction enables rapid migration                          |
| 6  | **High**     | Email is critical-path — it gates every user action                                     | Reputable provider, SPF/DKIM, outbox with retry, monitoring, resend                             |
| 7  | **Medium**   | Mixed-order partial refunds are the most bug-prone path                                 | Per-line modelling from the start; mandatory heavy test coverage                                |
| 8  | **Medium**   | Manual fulfillment by one person; no tracking evidence for disputes                     | Internal notes, audit log, status emails, published policy                                      |
| 9  | **Medium**   | Open reviews permit fake ratings that poison Top Rated                                  | Verified badge, one per user, moderation, rate limiting                                         |
| 10 | **Medium**   | Single payment provider; no fallback                                                    | Provider abstraction ready for a second adapter                                                 |
| 11 | **Medium**   | Unauthenticated guest uploads on a host co-locating database and inventory              | Content validation, re-encoding, scanning, quotas, private storage, retention                   |
| 12 | **Medium**   | Disk exhaustion corrupts the database                                                   | Retention policies, partitioning, disk alerting above 80%                                       |
| 14 | **Medium**   | No product variants; colour requests divert to WhatsApp                                 | Accepted limitation; monitor WhatsApp volume for reconsideration                                |
| 15 | **Low-Med**  | International demand may arrive before zones are enabled                                | WhatsApp quotation path; zone model already built                                               |
| 16 | **Low-Med**  | No caching or CDN                                                                       | Monitor; add when metrics justify                                                               |
| 17 | **Low**      | Account deletion versus record retention tension                                        | Anonymise rather than purge; block while orders open                                            |

## 30. Open Decisions

None block the start of development. Each should close before its module is built.
