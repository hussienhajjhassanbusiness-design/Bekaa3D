# Project Brief — Bekaa3D

> This brief summarizes the business case behind the SRS. Where it conflicts with
> [`docs/SRS.md`](../SRS.md), the SRS wins — that document is the single source of truth.

## Project Classification

**Category:** Complex transactional commerce platform
**Profile:** C — Complex backend

**Reason:**

Bekaa3D is a production dual-commerce platform that sells both made-to-order physical products and downloadable STL files.

The backend handles online payments, payment webhooks, independently verified transactions, mixed orders, per-line fulfillment, partial refunds, digital entitlements, protected file downloads, offer negotiations, full-text search, user-generated uploads, audit logging, and several reliability-critical background jobs.

Its classification is driven by transactional and operational complexity rather than traffic volume. Payment verification, entitlement granting, refunds, checkout idempotency, concurrency races, file security, and recovery procedures must remain correct even when the number of users is relatively small.

**Current deliberate exclusions:**

- No microservices; bounded contexts remain within a modular monolith
- No Kubernetes
- No multi-region deployment
- No active-active or automatic failover
- No object storage or CDN in V1
- No dedicated external search engine
- No second payment provider in V1
- No courier API integration
- No international shipping
- No mobile applications
- No product variants
- No cash on delivery
- No tax or VAT calculation
- No event-streaming platform such as Kafka

**Required Profile C components:**

- Clean Architecture with domain, application, infrastructure, and API layers
- Repository abstractions for domain aggregates
- PostgreSQL constraints protecting business invariants
- Redis for queues, rate limits, and appropriate short-lived coordination
- Background workers and scheduled jobs
- Transactional email outbox with retries
- Idempotency for checkout, refunds, and payment callbacks
- Independent server-side payment verification
- Payment reconciliation for missed callbacks
- Structured logging, audit logging, monitoring, and alerting
- Protected private-file storage and authorised download delivery
- Malware scanning and secure upload processing
- Automated backups with restoration verification
- Staging environment and CI/CD with rollback support
- Unit, integration, contract, end-to-end, concurrency, and security testing

**Upgrade triggers:**

- Concurrent usage consistently approaches or exceeds the 200-user target
- Catalogue size approaches or exceeds 10,000 products
- Local file storage creates disk-capacity, backup, or download-bandwidth problems
- The 99% availability target becomes insufficient for the business
- A single server becomes an unacceptable point of failure
- PostgreSQL full-text and trigram search no longer meet search-quality or latency targets
- Whish outages or business requirements justify a second payment provider
- Download traffic justifies object storage and CDN delivery
- Background-job volume requires independently scalable worker pools
- Multiple development teams need independent ownership and deployment cycles
- Operational complexity justifies container orchestration
- International shipping, courier tracking, mobile applications, or multi-vendor selling enter the confirmed scope

**Architecture boundary:**

Profile C does not automatically mean microservices or Kubernetes. Bekaa3D should begin as a modular monolith deployed through Docker Compose, with clear bounded contexts and infrastructure abstractions. More distributed infrastructure should be introduced only when measured operational or organizational pressure justifies it.

## Problem

Bekaa3D currently lacks a unified platform for selling both made-to-order physical 3D-printed products and downloadable STL files. Customers need a trustworthy storefront where they can discover products, pay online, negotiate STL prices, track physical orders, and securely access purchased files.

The business administrator needs one operational system for managing products, payments, fulfillment, digital entitlements, refunds, customer requests, offers, notifications, and analytics without accessing the database directly.

## Today's Process

Based on the business context documented in the SRS, the current process is primarily relationship-based and handled through WhatsApp and manual communication.

Customers contact the business to ask about products, custom printing, prices, payment, production, and delivery. The administrator manually follows conversations, confirms payments, coordinates production and delivery, handles customer updates, and manages custom-printing requests.

WhatsApp will remain an intentional sales channel in V1, but online orders, STL purchases, payment verification, downloads, and fulfillment records will be managed through the platform.

## Cost of the Status Quo

**Numeric baseline:** not supplied in the SRS.

The following measurements must be collected before or during early development:

- Administrator hours spent handling orders each week
- Median time required to confirm a payment
- Missed or duplicated orders per month
- Customer enquiries that receive no response
- Refund obligations that remain unresolved
- Custom-printing leads lost before receiving a quotation
- Time spent manually sending files and order updates
- Customer disputes caused by missing payment, download, or fulfillment records

A four-week baseline should be recorded before production launch so post-launch improvement can be measured.

## Success Metrics

The project is successful when:

- 100% of online payments are independently verified server-side before manufacturing begins or an STL entitlement is granted.
- A verified customer can complete the full STL journey — discovery, checkout, payment, entitlement, and download — without manual administrator intervention.
- A verified customer can complete a physical-product order and follow it through delivery or workshop pickup.
- 100% of V1 administrative operations can be completed through the dashboard without direct database access.
- Catalogue endpoints respond in less than 500 ms at p95.
- Search responds in less than 800 ms at p95.
- Checkout completes in less than 2 seconds, excluding the payment-provider redirect.
- Download authorization begins in less than 300 ms at p95.
- The platform supports 200 concurrent users without degradation.
- Monthly availability is at least 99%.
- The catalogue supports 10,000 products without index redesign.

The SRS defines the core business success criteria as permanent STL access, trackable physical orders, continued WhatsApp accessibility, complete dashboard operation, and independently verified payments.

## Constraints

### Team

- Three-person development team
- Responsibilities must be divided by bounded context or delivery phase
- The project should remain a modular monolith to avoid unnecessary distributed-system overhead

### Budget

- Previously discussed target: approximately USD 3,000
- Negotiable lower limit: approximately USD 2,500
- This is a severe constraint for a Profile C system and requires strict scope control and phased delivery

### Market and operations

- Primary market: Lebanon
- Prices are stored and charged in USD
- Physical products are made on demand
- Physical fulfillment is manually managed
- Workshop pickup and Lebanese delivery zones are supported
- WhatsApp remains an important purchasing and communication path
- V1 has one primary administrator

### Technology

- Python 3.13
- FastAPI
- Pydantic v2
- SQLAlchemy 2 async
- Alembic
- PostgreSQL 16
- Redis
- arq workers and scheduled jobs
- nginx
- ClamAV
- Docker Compose
- Single-VPS deployment for V1

The SRS requires Clean Architecture with domain, application, infrastructure, and API layers, organized as bounded contexts within one backend.

### Payment integration

- Whish is the only payment provider in V1
- Merchant credentials are required for live payment delivery
- Webhook-signature support, status-query support, refunds, rate limits, sandbox availability, and settlement behavior remain dependent on Whish
- No product or entitlement may be granted solely because a callback was received

### Hosting and reliability

- V1 runs on a single VPS
- The single server is an acknowledged availability limitation
- PostgreSQL data, private files, uploads, backups, and logs require active disk monitoring
- Off-server encrypted backups are mandatory
- A staging environment is required before enabling live payments

### Language and accessibility

- English only at launch; no localization or RTL support
- Product names are required
- WCAG 2.1 AA is the accessibility target

### Security and legal

- Personally identifiable information must be protected and excluded from logs
- Payment, authentication, download, upload, and administrator actions must be audited
- Uploaded content must be validated, re-encoded where applicable, malware-scanned, and stored privately
- Terms, privacy, refund policy, invoicing requirements, and damaged-goods policy must be approved before launch
- The SRS does not identify a named regulatory compliance regime

## Deadline and Milestones

**Calendar deadline:** Not specified in the SRS.

The delivery milestone is a phased V1 release:

| Phase | Contents | Blocked by Whish? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **0 — Foundation** | Database, authentication, verification, admin foundation, catalogue, search, settings, outbox, and job infrastructure | No |
| **1 — Storefront** | Public pages, reviews, wishlist, notifications, Bring Your Idea, contact, and WhatsApp paths | No |
| **2 — Commerce** | Cart, checkout, orders, fulfillment, shipping, pickup, cancellation, and refunds using a mock payment provider | No |
| **3 — Digital** | STL versions, entitlements, downloads, and offers | No |
| **4 — Live payments** | Whish integration, callbacks, independent verification, reconciliation, and manual-confirmation fallback | **Yes** |
| **5 — Hardening** | Rate limits, captcha, malware scanning, MFA, monitoring, backup drill, data rights, and load testing | No |

Production launch must not occur before Phase 4 and Phase 5 acceptance. Only the live-payment phase is blocked by Whish credentials.
