# Bekaa3D — Database Design

**Document:** `database-design.md`  
**Status:** Step 12 — Database Design COMPLETE / Schema Frozen for V1  
**Database:** PostgreSQL 16  
**ORM / migrations:** SQLAlchemy 2.0 Async + Alembic  
**Source of truth:** `Bekaa3D_SRS_Complete.md`  
**Purpose:** Convert the approved domain model and business rules into an implementation-ready relational database design before SQLAlchemy models or migrations are written.


## Schema Freeze Summary

The V1 relational design is now complete. Where the approved SRS was silent on a low-level implementation detail, this document records an explicit **V1 design assumption** rather than presenting it as an SRS requirement. Material business changes still require the SRS/ERD to be updated first.

Final Step-12 decisions include:

- explicit shipping-zone selection; no automatic geographic mapping table in V1;
- conservative 1-year capacity envelopes for schema/index review;
- frozen implementation enum values;
- soft-deleted wishlist rows;
- refresh-token rotation/reuse detection using session token versions;
- explicit retention exceptions for data the SRS requires to be physically purged.

## 1. Design Principles

1. The database is the final integrity boundary. Application validation gives useful errors; database constraints prevent invalid states under concurrency.
2. Business-history records are preserved. Orders, order lines, payments, refunds, offer history, entitlements, and audit history are not casually deleted.
3. Monetary snapshots and order-line snapshots are immutable after placement.
4. Order status is a projection of payment and line states; application code must not treat it as an independently editable business field.
5. External identifiers, user input, prices, payment callbacks, and client-computed totals are never trusted without server-side validation.
6. PostgreSQL constraints and partial unique indexes enforce invariants that application-level “check then insert” logic could race on.
7. The schema is designed for the V1 scale target: at least 10,000 catalogue products and 200 concurrent users without an index redesign.
8. Redis, workers, caching, and other infrastructure do not replace relational integrity.

# 2. Global Database Conventions

| Concern | Standard |
|---|---|
| Database | PostgreSQL 16 |
| Table naming | plural `snake_case` |
| Column naming | `snake_case` |
| Primary keys | UUID, time-ordered where available |
| Foreign keys | `<entity>_id` |
| Timestamps | `TIMESTAMPTZ`, UTC |
| Money | `BIGINT` integer cents + `CHAR(3)` currency |
| Currency in V1 | USD |
| JSON | `JSONB` only |
| Enums | Native PostgreSQL enum types |
| Soft delete | nullable `deleted_at` on soft-deletable entities |
| Search | PostgreSQL FTS + trigram |
| Migrations | Alembic, forward-only operational posture, expand-contract for production changes |
| Email | `CITEXT` |
| Nullability | `NOT NULL` by default; nullable only for a named business reason |
| External list queries | bounded/paginated |
| Historical snapshots | copied into order/order-item rows; never read from mutable catalogue data |

### 2.1 Required PostgreSQL Extensions

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pgcrypto;
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS citext;
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm;
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS unaccent;
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS btree_gin;
```

### 2.2 Standard Timestamp Columns

Normal mutable entities generally use:

```text
created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL
updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL
```

Append-only entities generally use only:

```text
created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL
```

Soft-deletable entities use:

```text
deleted_at TIMESTAMPTZ NULL
```

### 2.3 Money Rules

Every monetary amount uses integer cents:

```text
price_cents BIGINT
shipping_cents BIGINT
total_cents BIGINT
amount_cents BIGINT
```

Every monetary row also carries:

```text
currency CHAR(3)
```

V1 business rule:

```text
currency = 'USD'
```

Never use `FLOAT`, `REAL`, or binary floating-point for money.

### 2.4 Known Deletion/Retention Specification Tension

The business-rules register contains a blanket statement that entities use soft delete, while later requirements explicitly require:

- purging never-verified accounts after a configured period;
- purging expired custom-request attachments from disk and database;
- pruning raw download records after the retention period;
- archiving old audit partitions.

**Design resolution used in this document:** core business/catalogue records use soft delete or anonymisation; ephemeral/security tokens and explicit retention-managed records may be physically purged when their specific retention rule requires it.

This resolution must be kept visible in the project documentation. If the product owner intends “never hard delete” literally even for ephemeral/retention data, this policy must be revised before migrations are created.

# 3. Enum Catalogue

The exact PostgreSQL enum names may change during implementation, but these values represent the approved state models.

## 3.1 `user_role`

```text
customer
admin
```

Future roles may be added without redesigning the user table.

## 3.2 `product_type`

```text
physical
stl
```

## 3.3 `purchase_mode`

```text
online_only
whatsapp_only
both
```

## 3.4 `fulfillment_method`

```text
delivery
pickup
```

`NULL` means no physical fulfillment, as in a digital-only order.

## 3.5 `order_source`

```text
cart
offer
```

## 3.6 `order_status`

Derived projection only:

```text
pending_payment
cancelled
refunded
partially_refunded
completed
in_progress
```

## 3.7 `order_item_status`

Combined storage enum for line state. Legal transitions depend on product type and fulfillment method.

```text
pending
granted
revoked
in_production
ready_to_ship
shipped
delivered
returned
ready_for_pickup
picked_up
cancelled
refunded
```

## 3.8 `payment_status`

```text
pending
processing
paid
partially_refunded
refunded
failed
expired
```

## 3.9 `offer_status`

```text
awaiting_admin
awaiting_customer
accepted
rejected
expired
withdrawn
paid
checkout_expired
auto_closed
```

## 3.10 `offer_turn`

```text
admin
customer
```

## 3.11 `custom_request_status`

```text
new
contacted
quoted
in_progress
completed
closed
lost
```

## 3.12 `contact_message_status`

```text
new
read
replied
archived
```

## 3.13 Final Implementation Enums

The SRS requires these concepts but does not prescribe every exact implementation value. The following values are **V1 schema-freeze decisions**, not new business requirements.

### `malware_scan_status`

```text
pending
clean
infected
failed
```

### `entitlement_source`

```text
purchase
offer
admin_grant
```

### `refund_status`

```text
pending
processing
settled
failed
```

### `refund_method`

```text
provider
manual
```

### `offer_actor`

```text
customer
admin
system
```

### `offer_action`

```text
submitted
countered
accepted
rejected
withdrawn
expired
paid
checkout_expired
auto_closed
```

### `notification_type`

```text
account
order
payment
refund
offer
download
```

The specific event is carried in the JSON payload; the enum remains a stable high-level category.

### `setting_type`

```text
boolean
integer
string
money
duration
json
```

### `outbox_status`

```text
pending
sending
sent
failed
```

### `custom_request_outcome`

```text
won
lost
```

### `payment_provider`

```text
whish
```

A new payment provider requires an additive enum migration before its adapter is enabled.

# 5. Identity Tables

## 5.1 `users`

**Purpose:** Stores customer and administrator accounts.

| Column | Type | Null | Key / Constraint | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| `id` | UUID | No | PK | Time-ordered UUID preferred |
| `email` | CITEXT | No | partial unique | Login identifier |
| `password_hash` | TEXT | No |  | Argon2id hash |
| `role` | `user_role` | No |  | Default `customer` |
| `email_verified_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Yes |  | `NULL` = unverified |
| `is_active` | BOOLEAN | No |  | Default `TRUE` |
| `anonymized_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Yes |  | Account deletion/anonymisation |
| `deleted_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Yes |  | Soft-delete marker where applicable |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |  | UTC |
| `updated_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |  | UTC |

### Constraints

```text
UNIQUE lower(email) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL
```

Because `CITEXT` is used, the implementation may use a direct unique partial index on `email` instead of `lower(email)`.

### Deletion

- Verified customers: anonymise rather than purge.
- Login is disabled after anonymisation.
- Financial/download records remain.
- Deletion is blocked while orders are open or refunds are unsettled.
- Never-verified accounts may be physically purged after the configured retention period.

### Important Indexes

- unique live email;
- `created_at` if admin customer reporting requires it;
- `email_verified_at`/`created_at` partial index may be added for the unverified-account purge job.

---

## 5.2 `addresses`

**Purpose:** Customer saved delivery address book.

| Column | Type | Null | Key / Constraint |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `id` | UUID | No | PK |
| `user_id` | UUID | No | FK → `users.id` |
| `label` | TEXT | No |  |
| `recipient_name` | TEXT | No |  |
| `phone` | TEXT | No |  |
| `governorate` | TEXT | No |  |
| `city` | TEXT | No |  |
| `area` | TEXT | Yes |  |
| `street` | TEXT | Yes |  |
| `landmark_notes` | TEXT | Yes |  |
| `is_default` | BOOLEAN | No | Default `FALSE` |
| `deleted_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Yes |  |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |  |
| `updated_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |  |

### Constraints

At most one active default address per user:

```text
UNIQUE(user_id)
WHERE is_default = TRUE AND deleted_at IS NULL
```

### FK Delete

`users → addresses`: `ON DELETE CASCADE` is acceptable only for the physical purge of a never-verified account. Normal verified-account deletion is anonymisation, not hard deletion.

### Important Note

Orders do **not** depend on the mutable address row for historical truth. Address data is copied into the order as an immutable snapshot.

---

## 5.3 `sessions`

**Purpose:** Stores hashed rotating refresh-token/session state.

| Column | Type | Null | Key / Constraint |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `id` | UUID | No | PK |
| `user_id` | UUID | No | FK → `users.id` |
| `refresh_token_hash` | TEXT | No | UNIQUE |
| `token_version` | INTEGER | No | Default `1`; CHECK > 0 |
| `expires_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |  |
| `last_used_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Yes |  |
| `rotated_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Yes | last successful rotation |
| `revoked_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Yes |  |
| `reuse_detected_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Yes | stale-token reuse detection |
| `ip_hash` | TEXT | Yes |  |
| `user_agent` | TEXT | Yes |  |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |  |

### FK Delete

`ON DELETE CASCADE` for an account that is legitimately physically purged.

### Indexes

```text
(user_id)
(expires_at) WHERE revoked_at IS NULL
```

### Refresh-Token Rotation / Reuse Detection — Final V1 Decision

One `sessions` row represents one browser/device login session.

The refresh token contains a signed reference to the session plus its `token_version`. On successful refresh:

1. lock the session row;
2. verify it is not revoked/expired;
3. verify the presented version and token hash;
4. issue a new refresh token;
5. replace `refresh_token_hash`;
6. increment `token_version`;
7. set `rotated_at`.

If a validly signed token references the session but carries an older version, treat it as **refresh-token reuse**:

```text
reuse_detected_at = now()
revoked_at = now()
```

and require a new login.

This gives rotation/reuse protection without creating a separate refresh-token-history table.

---

## 5.4 `verification_tokens`

| Column | Type | Null | Key / Constraint |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `id` | UUID | No | PK |
| `user_id` | UUID | No | FK → `users.id` |
| `token_hash` | TEXT | No | UNIQUE |
| `expires_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |  |
| `used_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Yes |  |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |  |

### Retention

Ephemeral. Expired/used rows may be purged according to security retention policy.

---

## 5.5 `password_reset_tokens`

| Column | Type | Null | Key / Constraint |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `id` | UUID | No | PK |
| `user_id` | UUID | No | FK → `users.id` |
| `token_hash` | TEXT | No | UNIQUE |
| `expires_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |  |
| `used_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Yes |  |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |  |

### Retention

Ephemeral. Expired/used rows may be purged.

---

## 5.6 `mfa_credentials`

**Purpose:** One optional MFA credential per account; required for administrators before full admin access.

| Column | Type | Null | Key / Constraint |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `id` | UUID | No | PK |
| `user_id` | UUID | No | FK → `users.id`; UNIQUE |
| `method` | TEXT / enum | No | V1 = `totp` |
| `secret_ciphertext` | BYTEA | No | application-encrypted TOTP secret |
| `enabled_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Yes | NULL until enrollment confirmed |
| `last_used_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Yes |  |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |  |
| `updated_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |  |

### Rules

- admin access requires an enabled MFA credential;
- the raw TOTP secret is never stored plaintext;
- enrollment creates/updates the credential but `enabled_at` remains NULL until a valid TOTP is confirmed;
- deleting/disabling MFA is not a normal V1 admin action because SEC-04 treats MFA as required.

### FK Delete

`ON DELETE CASCADE` is acceptable only when a user is legitimately physically purged. Normal verified-user deletion remains anonymisation.

---

## 5.7 `mfa_recovery_codes`

**Purpose:** One-time recovery codes for an enabled MFA credential.

| Column | Type | Null | Key / Constraint |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `id` | UUID | No | PK |
| `mfa_credential_id` | UUID | No | FK → `mfa_credentials.id` |
| `code_hash` | TEXT | No | UNIQUE |
| `used_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Yes | one-time use |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |  |

### Rules

- only hashes are stored;
- plaintext recovery codes are returned once at generation time;
- successful recovery-code use sets `used_at`;
- regeneration invalidates/removes prior unused code set and creates a new set;
- MFA recovery events are audit-logged.

### Index

```text
(mfa_credential_id) WHERE used_at IS NULL
```

### FK Delete

`mfa_credentials → mfa_recovery_codes`: `ON DELETE CASCADE`.

---

# 6. Catalogue Tables

## 6.1 `categories`

**Purpose:** Main product categories. V1 has no category hierarchy/subcategories.

| Column | Type | Null | Key / Constraint |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `id` | UUID | No | PK |
| `name` | TEXT | No |  |
| `slug` | TEXT | No | partial unique |
| `is_active` | BOOLEAN | No | Default `TRUE` |
| `deleted_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Yes |  |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |  |
| `updated_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |  |

### Constraints

```text
UNIQUE(slug) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL
```

### Rules

- A category cannot be deleted/archive-finalised while products are assigned.
- Products must be reassigned first.
- Storefront products must belong to an active category.
- Soft-deleting a category releases its slug (same-transaction `deleted_at`).

### FK Delete

`products.category_id → categories.id` uses `ON DELETE RESTRICT`.

---

## 6.2 `materials`

**Purpose:** Admin-managed controlled material list used for physical product faceting.

| Column | Type | Null |
|---|---|---:|
| `id` | UUID | No |
| `name` | TEXT | No |
| `is_active` | BOOLEAN | No |
| `deleted_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Yes |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |
| `updated_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |

Products referencing a material prevent destructive removal.

---

## 6.3 `colours`

**Purpose:** Admin-managed controlled colour list used for physical product faceting.

| Column | Type | Null |
|---|---|---:|
| `id` | UUID | No |
| `name` | TEXT | No |
| `is_active` | BOOLEAN | No |
| `deleted_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Yes |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |
| `updated_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |

---

## 6.4 `products`

**Purpose:** Single catalogue root for both physical products and STL products. Catalogue text (name, description, slug, SEO metadata) lives directly on this table — see ADR-016; there is no separate translation table.

**Important:** There is no `stock_quantity`; physical products are manufactured on demand.

| Column | Type | Null | Key / Constraint |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `id` | UUID | No | PK |
| `type` | `product_type` | No | type-integrity checks |
| `category_id` | UUID | No | FK → `categories.id` |
| `name` | TEXT | No |  |
| `description` | TEXT | Yes |  |
| `slug` | TEXT | No | partial unique |
| `seo_title` | TEXT | Yes |  |
| `seo_description` | TEXT | Yes |  |
| `og_image_url` | TEXT | Yes |  |
| `search_vector` | TSVECTOR | No | generated/stored |
| `price_cents` | BIGINT | No | CHECK ≥ 0 |
| `currency` | CHAR(3) | No | CHECK = `USD` in V1 |
| `is_visible` | BOOLEAN | No | Default `FALSE` |
| `is_featured` | BOOLEAN | No | Default `FALSE` |
| `is_available` | BOOLEAN | No | Default `TRUE` |
| `average_rating` | NUMERIC(3,2) | No | Default 0; CHECK 0..5 |
| `review_count` | INTEGER | No | Default 0; CHECK ≥ 0 |
| `wishlist_count` | INTEGER | No | Default 0; CHECK ≥ 0 |
| `download_count` | BIGINT | No | Default 0; CHECK ≥ 0 |
| `purchase_mode` | `purchase_mode` | Yes | physical only |
| `material_id` | UUID | Yes | FK → `materials.id`; physical only |
| `colour_id` | UUID | Yes | FK → `colours.id`; physical only |
| `dimensions` | JSONB | Yes | physical only |
| `production_lead_time_days` | INTEGER | Yes | physical only; CHECK ≥ 0 |
| `batch_size` | INTEGER | Yes | physical only; CHECK > 0 |
| `max_quantity_per_line` | INTEGER | Yes | physical only; CHECK > 0 |
| `weight_grams` | INTEGER | Yes | physical only; optional; CHECK > 0 when present |
| `deleted_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Yes |  |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |  |
| `updated_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |  |

### Constraints

```text
UNIQUE(slug) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL
```

### Type Integrity

For `physical`:

```text
purchase_mode IS NOT NULL
production_lead_time_days IS NOT NULL
batch_size IS NOT NULL AND batch_size > 0
max_quantity_per_line IS NOT NULL AND max_quantity_per_line > 0
```

Material and colour are catalogue attributes but the SRS does not explicitly state they are mandatory for every physical product; keep them nullable unless the approved requirement is tightened.

For `stl`:

```text
purchase_mode IS NULL
material_id IS NULL
colour_id IS NULL
dimensions IS NULL
production_lead_time_days IS NULL
batch_size IS NULL
max_quantity_per_line IS NULL
weight_grams IS NULL
```

### Important Rules

- WhatsApp-only products may be viewed but cannot enter cart/checkout.
- Unavailable products remain visible for SEO but cannot be added to cart.
- Product purchase mode and availability are revalidated at checkout.
- No variants are modeled in V1.
- Catalogue price is mutable; order-line price is an immutable snapshot.
- `average_rating`, `review_count`, `wishlist_count`, and `download_count` are maintained aggregates, not client-supplied values.
- Soft-deleting a product releases its slug (same-transaction `deleted_at`).

### Search

- PostgreSQL `english` text search configuration only.
- Search vector weights product name above description.
- Trigram index on name supports typo tolerance/autocomplete.

### FK Delete

- category/material/colour references: `ON DELETE RESTRICT`.
- order history referencing products: `ON DELETE RESTRICT`.

---

## 6.5 `product_images`

| Column | Type | Null | Constraint |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `id` | UUID | No | PK |
| `product_id` | UUID | No | FK → `products.id` |
| `storage_key` | TEXT | No |  |
| `alt_text` | TEXT | Yes | implementation choice |
| `sort_order` | INTEGER | No | CHECK ≥ 0 |
| `is_cover` | BOOLEAN | No | Default `FALSE` |
| `deleted_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Yes | soft-delete marker |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |  |
| `updated_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |  |

### Constraint

At most one **active** cover image per product:

```text
UNIQUE(product_id)
WHERE is_cover = TRUE AND deleted_at IS NULL
```

### Deletion

Admin image removal soft-deletes the metadata row. The physical media object may be garbage-collected later only when storage-retention policy confirms it is no longer referenced.

---

# 7. Digital Asset Tables

## 7.1 `asset_versions`

**Purpose:** Versioned STL bundles. One version contains one or more files.

| Column | Type | Null | Constraint |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `id` | UUID | No | PK |
| `product_id` | UUID | No | FK → `products.id` |
| `version_number` | INTEGER | No | CHECK > 0 |
| `is_current` | BOOLEAN | No | Default `FALSE` |
| `published_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Yes |  |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |  |

### Constraints

```text
UNIQUE(product_id, version_number)
UNIQUE(product_id) WHERE is_current = TRUE
```

### Rules

- Only STL products may have asset versions.
- Version supersession is atomic.
- Superseded versions/files are retained.
- Entitlement holders always receive the current version.

The cross-table rule “product must be STL” is enforced by the service transaction because a normal CHECK cannot query another table.

---

## 7.2 `stl_assets`

**Purpose:** Private physical file objects belonging to an asset version.

| Column | Type | Null | Constraint |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `id` | UUID | No | PK |
| `asset_version_id` | UUID | No | FK → `asset_versions.id` |
| `storage_key` | TEXT | No | UNIQUE |
| `original_filename` | TEXT | No |  |
| `size_bytes` | BIGINT | No | CHECK > 0 |
| `sha256_checksum` | CHAR(64) | No |  |
| `mime_type` | TEXT | No |  |
| `scan_status` | enum | No | malware scan state |
| `scanned_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Yes | implementation support |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |  |

### Storage Rules

- Master assets are private.
- Public URL/path is never the authority.
- Disk/object-storage filename is server-generated, not the user filename.
- Original filename is metadata only.
- Files are scanned before being available for download.
- Superseded files are retained.

### `malware_scan_status`

```text
pending
clean
infected
failed
```

These values are frozen for V1.

---

## 7.3 `entitlements`

**Purpose:** Sole authority for whether a customer may download an STL product.

| Column | Type | Null | Constraint |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `id` | UUID | No | PK |
| `user_id` | UUID | No | FK → `users.id` |
| `product_id` | UUID | No | FK → `products.id` |
| `order_item_id` | UUID | Yes | FK → `order_items.id` |
| `source` | enum | No | purchase / accepted offer / admin grant |
| `granted_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |  |
| `revoked_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Yes |  |
| `revocation_reason` | TEXT | Yes | refund, chargeback, etc. |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |  |

### Critical Constraint

At most one active entitlement:

```text
UNIQUE(user_id, product_id)
WHERE revoked_at IS NULL
```

### Rules

- Grant happens atomically with verified payment.
- Revocation is timestamp-based, not deletion.
- Refunded/charged-back digital access is revoked.
- A user whose entitlement was revoked may purchase again.
- Download authorization checks this table, not order status.

### Proposed `entitlement_source`

```text
purchase
offer
admin_grant
```

---

## 7.4 `downloads`

**Purpose:** Detailed access log for every STL download.

**Partitioning:** monthly range partitions by `started_at`.

| Column | Type | Null | Constraint |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `id` | UUID | No | part of partition-aware PK |
| `user_id` | UUID | No | FK → `users.id` |
| `entitlement_id` | UUID | No | FK → `entitlements.id` |
| `stl_asset_id` | UUID | No | FK → `stl_assets.id` |
| `started_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No | partition key |
| `completed_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Yes |  |
| `bytes_sent` | BIGINT | No | Default 0; CHECK ≥ 0 |
| `ip_hash` | TEXT | No | salted hash |
| `user_agent` | TEXT | Yes |  |
| `is_resumed` | BOOLEAN | No | Default `FALSE` |

### Partition Primary Key Note

PostgreSQL requires a unique/primary constraint on a partitioned table to include the partition key. Use:

```text
PRIMARY KEY (id, started_at)
```

or keep `id` non-unique globally and enforce identification at the application layer. The preferred design here is the composite partition-aware primary key.

### Retention

- raw detail: 24 months;
- monthly aggregate: indefinitely;
- partitions created at least 3 months ahead;
- partition creation is an operational requirement because missing partitions cause inserts/download initiation to fail.

### Rules

Every download records:

- customer;
- entitlement;
- file;
- start/completion;
- bytes;
- salted IP hash;
- user agent;
- resume flag.

The application authorizes first, records the row, and delegates file byte streaming to nginx.

## 7.5 `download_stats_monthly`

**Purpose:** Permanent aggregate for dashboards and “most downloaded” queries.

| Column | Type | Null | Constraint |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `id` | UUID | No | PK |
| `month` | DATE | No |  |
| `product_id` | UUID | No | FK → `products.id` |
| `download_count` | BIGINT | No | CHECK ≥ 0 |
| `unique_users` | BIGINT | No | CHECK ≥ 0 |
| `bytes_sent` | BIGINT | No | CHECK ≥ 0 |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |  |
| `updated_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |  |

```text
UNIQUE(month, product_id)
```

# 8. Cart and Ordering Tables

## 8.1 `carts`

**Purpose:** One persistent cart per registered customer.

| Column | Type | Null | Constraint |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `id` | UUID | No | PK |
| `user_id` | UUID | No | FK → `users.id`; UNIQUE |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |  |
| `updated_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |  |

### Rules

- one cart per customer;
- may mix physical and STL lines;
- write access requires verified email.

---

## 8.2 `cart_items`

| Column | Type | Null | Constraint |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `id` | UUID | No | PK |
| `cart_id` | UUID | No | FK → `carts.id` |
| `product_id` | UUID | No | FK → `products.id` |
| `quantity` | INTEGER | No | CHECK > 0 |
| `price_snapshot_cents` | BIGINT | No | CHECK ≥ 0 |
| `currency` | CHAR(3) | No | CHECK = `USD` |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |  |
| `updated_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |  |

### Critical Constraint

```text
UNIQUE(cart_id, product_id)
```

### Rules

- adding the same product merges quantity;
- STL quantity must equal exactly 1;
- physical quantity must stay at/below current product cap;
- already-owned STL cannot be added;
- unavailable / deleted / invisible / WhatsApp-only products cannot be purchased online;
- price snapshot is compared with current product price during checkout.

### STL Quantity Check

The database can enforce:

```text
quantity > 0
```

but determining whether the referenced product is STL is cross-table. The transaction service must enforce `quantity = 1` for STL. If product type is also snapshotted into the cart line, a local CHECK could be used, but that duplication is not required by the SRS.

---

## 8.3 `orders`

**Purpose:** Immutable commercial order header plus derived operational status.

| Column | Type | Null | Constraint |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `id` | UUID | No | PK |
| `order_number` | TEXT | No | UNIQUE |
| `user_id` | UUID | No | FK → `users.id` |
| `source` | `order_source` | No |  |
| `status` | `order_status` | No | derived projection |
| `fulfillment_method` | `fulfillment_method` | Yes | NULL for digital-only |
| `shipping_zone_id` | UUID | Yes | FK → `shipping_zones.id` |
| `subtotal_cents` | BIGINT | No | CHECK ≥ 0 |
| `shipping_cents` | BIGINT | No | Default 0; CHECK ≥ 0 |
| `tax_cents` | BIGINT | No | Default 0; V1 CHECK = 0 |
| `total_cents` | BIGINT | No | CHECK ≥ 0 |
| `currency` | CHAR(3) | No | CHECK = `USD` |
| `recipient_name` | TEXT | Yes | delivery snapshot |
| `phone` | TEXT | Yes | delivery snapshot |
| `governorate` | TEXT | Yes | delivery snapshot |
| `city` | TEXT | Yes | delivery snapshot |
| `area` | TEXT | Yes | delivery snapshot |
| `street` | TEXT | Yes | delivery snapshot |
| `landmark_notes` | TEXT | Yes | delivery snapshot |
| `shipping_zone_name_snapshot` | TEXT | Yes | historical snapshot |
| `shipping_rate_cents_snapshot` | BIGINT | Yes | CHECK ≥ 0 when present |
| `customer_note` | TEXT | Yes | customer-visible origin |
| `admin_note` | TEXT | Yes | never customer-visible |
| `estimated_dispatch_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Yes | physical orders |
| `terms_accepted_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No | consent |
| `digital_terms_accepted_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Yes | required when digital lines exist |
| `placed_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |  |
| `completed_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Yes |  |
| `cancelled_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Yes |  |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |  |
| `updated_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |  |

### Arithmetic Constraint

```text
total_cents = subtotal_cents + shipping_cents + tax_cents
```

### Delivery Conditional Constraint

When `fulfillment_method = delivery`, at minimum the required address snapshot and shipping snapshot fields must be present.

Pickup:

- no shipping address required;
- shipping charge = 0.

Digital-only:

- `fulfillment_method IS NULL`;
- address not required;
- shipping = 0.

The fact that an order actually contains physical/digital lines is cross-row and must be validated transactionally.

### Rules

- no guest checkout;
- all amounts are recomputed server-side;
- order number is human-readable;
- status is derived, never independently assigned as business input;
- dispatch estimate uses lead time × `ceil(quantity / batch_size)` across physical lines;
- kill switch stops new checkout only;
- unpaid checkout expires according to settings;
- order snapshots do not change when the catalogue changes.

### Indexes

```text
(user_id, placed_at DESC)
(status, placed_at DESC)
```

## 8.4 `order_items`

**Purpose:** Immutable line-level commercial snapshot and fulfillment state.

| Column | Type | Null | Constraint |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `id` | UUID | No | PK |
| `order_id` | UUID | No | FK → `orders.id` |
| `product_id` | UUID | No | FK → `products.id` |
| `offer_id` | UUID | Yes | FK → `offers.id` |
| `product_type` | `product_type` | No | immutable snapshot |
| `product_name_snapshot` | TEXT | No | immutable snapshot |
| `image_snapshot` | TEXT | Yes | immutable snapshot |
| `unit_price_cents` | BIGINT | No | CHECK ≥ 0 |
| `quantity` | INTEGER | No | CHECK > 0 |
| `line_total_cents` | BIGINT | No | CHECK ≥ 0 |
| `currency` | CHAR(3) | No | CHECK = `USD` |
| `fulfillment_status` | `order_item_status` | No |  |
| `lead_time_days_snapshot` | INTEGER | Yes | physical only |
| `batch_size_snapshot` | INTEGER | Yes | physical only |
| `cancelled_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Yes |  |
| `fulfilled_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Yes |  |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |  |
| `updated_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |  |

### Constraints

```text
line_total_cents = unit_price_cents * quantity
```

For STL snapshots:

```text
product_type = stl → quantity = 1
```

For physical snapshots:

```text
lead_time_days_snapshot IS NOT NULL
batch_size_snapshot IS NOT NULL AND batch_size_snapshot > 0
```

For STL:

```text
lead_time_days_snapshot IS NULL
batch_size_snapshot IS NULL
```

### Rules

- lines are immutable commercial snapshots after order placement;
- status transitions are controlled by the state machine;
- per-line status is mandatory because mixed orders can resolve differently;
- digital fulfillment is independent of physical fulfillment;
- only pre-production physical lines may be self-cancelled;
- STL lines are never self-cancellable.

### Index

```text
(order_id)
(fulfillment_status, order_id) WHERE product_type = 'physical'
```

---

## 8.5 `order_status_history`

**Purpose:** Append-only history of order projection and, where used, line-status transitions.

| Column | Type | Null | Constraint |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `id` | UUID | No | PK |
| `order_id` | UUID | No | FK → `orders.id` |
| `order_item_id` | UUID | Yes | FK → `order_items.id` |
| `from_status` | TEXT | Yes | NULL for initial state |
| `to_status` | TEXT | No |  |
| `actor_user_id` | UUID | Yes | FK → `users.id`; NULL = system |
| `reason` | TEXT | Yes |  |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No | append-only |

### Rules

- no update/delete in normal business operation;
- system transitions are represented with `actor_user_id = NULL`;
- audit logging also records status transitions.

# 9. Payment and Refund Tables

## 9.1 `payments`

| Column | Type | Null | Constraint |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `id` | UUID | No | PK |
| `order_id` | UUID | No | FK → `orders.id` |
| `provider` | TEXT / enum | No | V1 = Whish |
| `provider_payment_id` | TEXT | Yes | provider reference |
| `status` | `payment_status` | No |  |
| `amount_cents` | BIGINT | No | CHECK ≥ 0 |
| `currency` | CHAR(3) | No | CHECK = `USD` |
| `initiated_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |  |
| `verified_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Yes |  |
| `failed_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Yes |  |
| `expired_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Yes |  |
| `provider_metadata` | JSONB | Yes | provider-specific metadata only |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |  |
| `updated_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |  |

### Critical Constraint

Only one live payment per order:

```text
UNIQUE(order_id)
WHERE status IN ('pending', 'processing', 'paid')
```

If `partially_refunded` should still block a new payment attempt, include it in the live-state predicate during implementation. The business meaning is that an already-paid order cannot receive a second payment attempt.

### Rules

- callback/webhook is not proof;
- independent provider verification confirms payment;
- confirmed amount must equal order total;
- no production or entitlement before payment verification;
- reconciliation job handles missed callbacks.

### Index

```text
(status, initiated_at)
WHERE status = 'processing'
```

---

## 9.2 `webhook_events`

**Purpose:** Durable, idempotent receipt of provider callbacks before asynchronous/independent verification.

| Column | Type | Null | Constraint |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `id` | UUID | No | PK |
| `provider` | TEXT / enum | No |  |
| `provider_event_id` | TEXT | No |  |
| `event_type` | TEXT | Yes |  |
| `payload` | JSONB | No | raw/normalised provider event |
| `signature_valid` | BOOLEAN | Yes | if provider supports signature |
| `received_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |  |
| `processed_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Yes |  |
| `processing_error` | TEXT | Yes |  |

### Critical Constraint

```text
UNIQUE(provider, provider_event_id)
```

Duplicate webhook delivery must not double-grant entitlements or repeat state transitions.

---

## 9.3 `refunds`

**Purpose:** Tracks a refund obligation from request through settlement.

| Column | Type | Null | Constraint |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `id` | UUID | No | PK |
| `order_id` | UUID | No | FK → `orders.id` |
| `payment_id` | UUID | No | FK → `payments.id` |
| `amount_cents` | BIGINT | No | CHECK > 0 |
| `currency` | CHAR(3) | No | CHECK = `USD` |
| `shipping_refund_cents` | BIGINT | No | Default 0; CHECK ≥ 0 |
| `reason` | TEXT | No |  |
| `requested_by` | UUID | No | FK → `users.id` |
| `approved_by` | UUID | Yes | FK → `users.id` |
| `method` | enum | No | provider/manual |
| `status` | enum | No | settlement state |
| `provider_refund_id` | TEXT | Yes |  |
| `initiated_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |  |
| `settled_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Yes |  |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |  |
| `updated_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |  |

### Proposed `refund_status`

```text
pending
processing
settled
failed
```

### Proposed `refund_method`

```text
provider
manual
```

Exact values require confirmation from the payment/refund implementation.

### Rules

- partial refund supported;
- refund may cover selected lines plus shipping;
- refund remains a tracked obligation until settled;
- digital refund revokes entitlement;
- an unsettled refund blocks account deletion.

### Index

```text
(created_at)
WHERE status IN ('pending', 'processing')
```

---

## 9.4 `refund_items`

| Column | Type | Null | Constraint |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `id` | UUID | No | PK |
| `refund_id` | UUID | No | FK → `refunds.id` |
| `order_item_id` | UUID | No | FK → `order_items.id` |
| `amount_cents` | BIGINT | No | CHECK > 0 |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |  |

### Constraint

A line should appear at most once in the same refund:

```text
UNIQUE(refund_id, order_item_id)
```

The sum of refund-item amounts plus shipping refund must be validated transactionally against `refunds.amount_cents` and against the amount originally paid/refundable. This is a cross-row invariant and is not a simple CHECK.

---

# 10. Fulfillment

## 10.1 `shipping_zones`

**Purpose:** Admin-managed Lebanese delivery zones with flat rates.

| Column | Type | Null | Constraint |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `id` | UUID | No | PK |
| `name` | TEXT | No | unique among live zones |
| `rate_cents` | BIGINT | No | CHECK ≥ 0 |
| `currency` | CHAR(3) | No | CHECK = `USD` |
| `is_active` | BOOLEAN | No | Default `TRUE` |
| `deleted_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Yes |  |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |  |
| `updated_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |  |

```text
UNIQUE(name) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL
```

### Rules

- V1 supports Lebanese zones only;
- international requests are redirected to WhatsApp;
- pickup is free and does not use a zone;
- selected zone name/rate are snapshotted onto the order;
- optional free-shipping threshold comes from `settings`.

### Zone Resolution — Final V1 Decision

V1 uses **explicit shipping-zone selection at checkout**.

- Admin manages `shipping_zones` and their flat rates.
- The customer selects an active zone when choosing Delivery.
- The client sends only `shipping_zone_id`; it never sends the trusted shipping amount.
- The server loads the active zone, reads `rate_cents` from PostgreSQL, applies any configured free-shipping rule, and snapshots the zone name/rate onto the order.
- The delivery address remains a separate immutable snapshot.
- No `shipping_zone_areas` / governorate-to-zone mapping table is added in V1.
- Pickup does not use a shipping zone.
- If the business later requires automatic address-to-zone validation, that is a new requirement and schema change.

This matches the SRS treatment of courier/per-zone rates as **data entry, not a schema blocker**.

# 11. Offer / Negotiation Tables

## 11.1 `offers`

| Column | Type | Null | Constraint |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `id` | UUID | No | PK |

| `checkout_expires_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Yes | accepted offer |
| `rejected_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Yes |  |
| `cooldown_until` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Yes | rejection cooldown |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |  |
| `updated_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |  |

### Critical Constraint

At most one live offer per customer/product:

```text
UNIQUE(user_id, product_id)
WHERE status IN ('awaiting_admin', 'awaiting_customer', 'accepted')
```

### Rules

- only STL products support offers;
- offer floor is configured in settings and validated on submission;
- counter rounds are unlimited;
- each counter changes turn and deadline;
- acceptance freezes price;
- after acceptance only checkout expiry matters;
- acquiring product by another route auto-closes the offer;
- rejection sets cooldown.

The rule “product must be STL” is cross-table and enforced by the offer service.

### Index

```text
(status, responds_by)

## 11.2 `offer_rounds`

**Purpose:** Permanent append-only negotiation history.

| Column | Type | Null | Constraint |

| `action` | enum | No | submission/counter/accept/etc. |
| `amount_cents` | BIGINT | Yes | CHECK > 0 when present |
| `currency` | CHAR(3) | Yes | if amount present |
| `message` | TEXT | Yes |  |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No | append-only |

```text
UNIQUE(offer_id, sequence)

### Rules

- never update negotiation history;
- never delete negotiation history during normal operations.

# 12. Engagement Tables

## 12.1 `reviews`

| Column | Type | Null | Constraint |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `id` | UUID | No | PK |

| `product_id` | UUID | No | FK → `products.id` |
| `rating` | SMALLINT | No | CHECK 1..5 |
| `body` | TEXT | Yes |  |
| `is_verified_purchase` | BOOLEAN | No | maintained projection |
| `is_hidden` | BOOLEAN | No | moderation state |
| `deleted_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Yes | user/admin soft delete |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |  |
| `updated_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |  |

### Critical Constraint

```text
UNIQUE(user_id, product_id)
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL
```

### Rules

- verified user may review without purchase;
- one review per user/product;
- verified-purchase badge depends on actual entitlement/physical-order evidence;
- badge is recomputed when entitlement is granted/revoked;
- admin may hide/restore;
- rating aggregate on product is recalculated on create/edit/delete/moderation.

## 12.2 `wishlist_items`

| Column | Type | Null | Constraint |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `id` | UUID | No | PK |
| `user_id` | UUID | No | FK → `users.id` |
| `product_id` | UUID | No | FK → `products.id` |
| `deleted_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Yes | soft-delete marker |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |  |
| `updated_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |  |

```text
UNIQUE(user_id, product_id)
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL
```

### Deletion Decision

Wishlist removal follows the SRS blanket soft-delete rule for business entities:

- remove = set `deleted_at`;
- re-add = create/restore one active row;
- product `wishlist_count` counts only active rows.

This keeps wishlist behavior consistent with BR-018 while preserving the normal add/remove user experience.

---

## 12.3 `notifications`

| Column | Type | Null | Constraint |
|---|---|---:|---|

| `created_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |  |

### Indexes

```text

(send_after)
WHERE status = 'pending'
```

### Transaction Rule

The outbox row is inserted **inside the same business transaction** that creates the event requiring the email. Delivery happens after commit.

---

## 13.4 `idempotency_records`

**Purpose:** Stores request identity and response for idempotent operations, especially checkout.

| Column | Type | Null | Constraint |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `id` | UUID | No | PK |
| `user_id` | UUID | Yes | FK → `users.id` |
| `scope` | TEXT | No | e.g. checkout |
| `key` | TEXT | No | client idempotency key |
| `request_hash` | CHAR(64) | No | hash of canonical request |
| `status_code` | INTEGER | Yes | stored HTTP result |
| `response_body` | JSONB | Yes | stored response |
| `expires_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No | retention |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | No |  |

### Critical Constraint

PostgreSQL 16 supports `NULLS NOT DISTINCT`. Use:

```text
UNIQUE NULLS NOT DISTINCT (scope, user_id, key)
```

For checkout, `user_id` is non-null in practice because guest checkout is forbidden.

### Replay Rules

- same key + same request hash → return stored response;
- same key + different request hash → conflict (`409`);
- record creation and order/payment creation must be coordinated transactionally.

### Index

```text
(expires_at)
```

for cleanup.

# 15. Database-Enforced Invariants

These are the most important constraints to express directly in PostgreSQL.

## 15.1 Identity

- unique live email;
- one active/default address per user;
- unique token hashes;
- at most one MFA credential per user;
- unique recovery-code hashes.

## 15.2 Catalogue

- non-negative price;
- V1 currency = USD;
- physical/STL type-integrity checks;
- one live slug per product;
- one cover image per product;
- rating aggregate 0..5;
- non-negative aggregate counters.

## 15.3 Cart

- one cart per user;
- one line per `(cart, product)`;
- quantity > 0;
- non-negative price snapshot.

## 15.4 Ordering

- unique order number;
- non-negative monetary values;
- total arithmetic;
- tax = 0 in V1;
- STL order-item quantity = 1;
- physical snapshot has lead-time and batch-size;
- delivery requires required address/shipping snapshot fields.

## 15.5 Digital Access

- one current asset version per product;
- one active entitlement per `(user, product)`;
- file sizes/bytes non-negative;
- retention/partition rules.

## 15.6 Payments

- one live payment per order;

## 15.8 Reviews/Wishlist

- rating integer 1..5;
- one active review per `(user, product)`;
- one **active** wishlist row per `(user, product)` via partial unique index.

---

# 16. Invariants That Require Transaction/Application Logic

Not every business rule can be expressed as a local SQL CHECK. These must be implemented in services/use cases with transactions and row locking where necessary.

1. Product name exists before publication.
2. Cart STL quantity is 1 based on the referenced product type.
3. Customer cannot add an STL product with an active entitlement.
4. Physical quantity cannot exceed the product's current max-per-line.
5. Product is visible, non-deleted, available, and permits online purchase at checkout.
6. Offer references an STL product only.
7. Asset version references an STL product only.
8. Entitlement is granted only after independently verified payment/admin grant.
9. Order status projection matches payment + line states.
10. Cancellation cutoff races against entering production; lock the same order-item row.
11. Refund-item totals do not exceed paid/refundable amounts.
12. Digital refund revokes entitlement in the same transaction.
13. Acquiring an STL through another route auto-closes the live offer.
14. Verified-purchase badge is recomputed when qualifying purchase/entitlement evidence changes.
15. Product rating/review/wishlist/download aggregates remain consistent with source rows.
16. Checkout idempotency record, order, lines, and initial payment are coordinated atomically.
17. Address/shipping requirement matches actual physical-line composition.
18. Dispatch estimate is calculated from physical order-line snapshots.
19. Kill switch blocks new checkout but not an in-flight payment.
20. Category cannot be archived/deleted while live products remain assigned.

---

# 17. State Machines

## 17.1 Payment

```text
pending -> processing -> paid -> partially_refunded -> refunded
   |          |
   |          -> failed
   -> expired
              -> expired
paid ---------------------------------------> refunded
```

`paid` requires independent server-side payment verification.

## 17.2 Order Projection

```text
payment pending/processing -> pending_payment
payment failed/expired     -> cancelled

payment paid:
  all lines cancelled      -> cancelled
  all lines refunded       -> refunded
  any refund present       -> partially_refunded
  no physical lines        -> completed
  all physical terminal    -> completed
  otherwise                -> in_progress
```

Projection is recomputed in the same transaction as payment/line changes.

## 17.3 Digital Order Line

```text
pending -> granted -> revoked
```

## 17.4 Physical Delivery Line

```text
pending
  -> in_production
      -> ready_to_ship
          -> shipped
              -> delivered
                  -> refunded
              -> returned
                  -> ready_to_ship
                  -> in_production
                  -> refunded

pending -> cancelled
in_production -> cancelled   # admin decision
```

`returned` is not terminal.

## 17.5 Physical Pickup Line

```text
pending -> in_production -> ready_for_pickup -> picked_up -> refunded
```

## 17.6 Offer

```text
awaiting_admin
  -> rejected
  -> accepted -> paid
              -> checkout_expired
              -> auto_closed
  -> awaiting_customer
       -> awaiting_admin
       -> withdrawn
       -> expired

awaiting_admin -> expired
```

Once accepted, the inactivity timer no longer controls the offer; only checkout expiry applies.

## 17.7 Custom Request

```text
new -> contacted -> quoted -> in_progress -> completed -> closed
          \           \
           -> lost     -> lost
```

---

# 18. Search Design

## 18.1 Product Search

`products.search_vector` is generated/stored:

```text
to_tsvector('english', ...)
```

Product name receives higher search weight than description.

## 18.2 Search Indexes

```text
GIN(products.search_vector)
GIN(products.name gin_trgm_ops)
```

Query strategy:

1. full-text search first;
2. trigram fallback when results are thin.

---

# 19. Index Strategy

Indexes are based on known query paths, not “index every column.”

## 19.1 Catalogue

```text
(type, category_id, price_cents)
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL AND is_visible = TRUE

(type, material_id, colour_id, price_cents)
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL AND is_visible = TRUE

(average_rating DESC)
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL AND is_visible = TRUE

(created_at DESC)
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL AND is_visible = TRUE
```

Because active category is also required for storefront visibility, query plans must be checked with the category join.

## 19.2 Product Slug/Search

```text
UNIQUE(slug) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL
GIN(search_vector)
GIN(name gin_trgm_ops)
```

## 19.3 Orders

```text
(user_id, placed_at DESC)
(status, placed_at DESC)
```

## 19.4 Order Fulfillment

```text
(fulfillment_status, order_id)
WHERE product_type = 'physical'
```

## 19.5 Entitlements

```text
(user_id)
WHERE revoked_at IS NULL
```

plus the critical unique active-entitlement index.

## 19.6 Offers

```text
(status, responds_by)
```

plus the unique live-offer index.

## 19.7 Email Outbox

```text
(send_after)
WHERE status = 'pending'
```

## 19.8 Payment Reconciliation

```text
(status, initiated_at)
WHERE status = 'processing'
```

## 19.9 Pending Refunds

```text
(created_at)
WHERE status IN ('pending', 'processing')
```

## 19.10 Notifications

```text
(user_id, created_at DESC)
(user_id, created_at DESC) WHERE read_at IS NULL
```

## 19.11 Retention Jobs

```text
verification_tokens(expires_at)
password_reset_tokens(expires_at)
sessions(expires_at) WHERE revoked_at IS NULL
custom_request_attachments(expires_at)
idempotency_records(expires_at)
```

---

# 20. Hot Query Catalogue

The schema/indexes must serve these expected high-value paths.

1. Browse visible products by type/category/price.
2. Filter physical products by material/colour/price.
3. Sort catalogue by price, rating, newest.
4. Search product names/descriptions.
5. Autocomplete/fuzzy product names.
6. Load a product with images/reviews summary.
7. Load customer's persistent cart and lines.
8. Validate active entitlement for `(user, product)`.
9. List customer's orders newest first.
10. Admin order queue by status/date/customer/fulfillment.
11. Load order + lines + payment/refund state.
12. Find processing payments for reconciliation.
13. Find pending refund obligations.
14. Find offers whose response deadline has expired.
15. Find pending email-outbox rows due for delivery.
16. List unread notifications for a user.
17. Authorize a download and fetch current asset version/files.
18. Aggregate dashboard “most downloaded” from monthly stats rather than raw downloads.
19. Admin Bring Your Idea queue by status/date.
20. Admin contact-message queue by status/date.

---

# 21. Partitioning and Retention

## 21.1 `downloads`

Partition:

```text
RANGE(started_at) by month
```

Retention:

- detailed rows: 24 months;
- `download_stats_monthly`: indefinite.

Operational rule:

- create partitions at least 3 months in advance;
- alert if future partitions are missing.

## 21.2 `audit_logs`

Partition:

```text
RANGE(created_at) by month
```

Retention:

- hot: 24 months;
- then archive according to operations policy.

## 21.3 Other Retention-Managed Records

- expired verification/password tokens: purge according to security policy;
- never-verified accounts: purge after configured period;
- custom-request attachments: purge after `expires_at`;
- idempotency records: purge after `expires_at`;
- sessions: purge after expiration/revocation retention;
- business-history rows: preserve/anonymise instead of normal hard delete.

---

# 22. Historical Snapshot Rules

These values must be copied at transaction time.

## Order Header Snapshots

- fulfillment method;
- recipient/address fields;
- shipping-zone name;
- shipping rate;
- subtotal/shipping/tax/total;
- currency;
- terms-consent timestamps;
- estimated dispatch timestamp.

## Order Line Snapshots

- product ID for traceability;
- product type;
- product name;
- image reference;
- unit price;
- quantity;
- line total;
- currency;
- lead-time days for physical lines;
- batch size for physical lines;
- accepted offer/agreed price when applicable.

### Rule

Later catalogue changes must never alter historical order values.

---

# 23. Delete / Archive / Retention Matrix

| Table | Strategy |
|---|---|
| users | anonymise verified accounts; purge never-verified accounts after configured period |
| addresses | soft delete; physical purge with safe never-verified user purge |
| sessions | revoke + retention purge |
| verification_tokens | retention purge |
| password_reset_tokens | retention purge |
| mfa_credentials | retain while account exists; required for admin; cascade only on legitimate physical purge |
| mfa_recovery_codes | one-time use; old sets invalidated on regeneration; retention purge allowed after security retention |
| categories | soft delete/archive; block while products assigned; release slug |
| materials | soft delete/archive |
| colours | soft delete/archive |
| products | soft delete; release slug |
| product_images | soft delete metadata; physical object garbage-collected only when unreferenced per storage lifecycle |
| asset_versions | retain |
| stl_assets | retain, including superseded versions |
| carts/cart_items | mutable operational data; cleanup allowed under account/cart lifecycle |
| orders | retain |
| order_items | retain |
| order_status_history | retain append-only |
| payments | retain |
| webhook_events | retention policy may archive/prune after audit period; not specified numerically |
| refunds | retain |
| refund_items | retain |
| shipping_zones | soft delete/archive |
| entitlements | revoke; never delete as normal business operation |
| downloads | retention prune after 24 months |
| download_stats_monthly | retain indefinitely |
| offers | retain |
| offer_rounds | retain permanently |
| reviews | soft delete/hide |
| wishlist_items | soft delete; partial unique index permits only one active row |
| notifications | retention policy not numerically specified |
| custom_requests | retain for funnel/history unless retention policy says otherwise |
| custom_request_attachments | physical purge after expiry |
| contact_messages | archive/status; retention not numerically specified |
| settings | retain; changes audited |
| audit_logs | partition + archive after 24 months hot |
| email_outbox | retain through operational/audit retention; exact period not specified |
| idempotency_records | purge after expiry |

### Wishlist Decision

Resolved for V1: `wishlist_items` uses soft delete with a partial unique active-row constraint. This follows BR-018 while preserving add/remove behavior.

# 25. Critical Concurrency Boundaries

These transactions require explicit locking/atomic constraints.

## Checkout

1. consume/validate idempotency key;
2. check kill switch;
3. lock cart;
4. validate every product;
5. recheck entitlement;
6. validate current quantities/caps;
7. resolve fulfillment and shipping;
8. recompute totals;
9. create order + lines + pending payment;
10. calculate dispatch snapshot;
11. clear cart;
12. persist consent;
13. commit.

## Payment Verification

Do not hold DB locks while calling provider.

Transaction A:

- persist webhook if present;
- commit.

External operation:

- verify/query provider.

Transaction B:

- lock payment/order;
- apply verified state;
- grant entitlements;
- transition physical lines;
- close live offer;
- recompute order status;
- write history/audit;
- insert email outbox rows;
- commit.

## Cancellation vs Production

Both self-cancel and admin `pending → in_production` transition lock the same `order_items` row. Exactly one operation wins.

## Offer Submission

The partial unique live-offer index is the final race-safe guarantee.

## Entitlement Grant

The partial unique active-entitlement index is the final race-safe guarantee.

## Payment Creation

The partial unique live-payment index is the final race-safe guarantee.

# 26. Database Migration Rules

1. Every schema change uses Alembic.
2. Never manually modify production schema outside an emergency procedure.
3. Review autogenerated migrations.
4. Production changes use expand-contract when old/new code may overlap.
5. Migration recovery strategy is documented:
   - code rollback compatible;
   - fix-forward;
   - restore where necessary.
6. Data migrations must be resumable or safely rerunnable when large.
7. Index creation on large live tables should use PostgreSQL's concurrent strategy where deployment tooling permits.
8. Partition creation is automated and monitored.
9. No application replicas independently running schema migration on startup.

---

# 27. NFR / Scale Design Inputs

Approved targets relevant to the database:

| Requirement | Target |
|---|---|
| Catalogue response | p95 < 500 ms |
| Search response | p95 < 800 ms |
| Checkout | < 2 s excluding provider redirect |
| Download initiation | < 300 ms |
| Concurrent users | 200 without degradation |
| Catalogue scale | 10,000 products without index redesign |
| Database RPO | ≤ 5 minutes |
| Recovery time | ≤ 4 hours |
| Timestamps | UTC mandatory |

### V1 Capacity Planning Envelope

The SRS provides performance targets but not business-volume forecasts. The following are therefore **engineering planning assumptions for schema/index review**, not sales forecasts. Re-estimate after the first 90 days of real production traffic.

| Table | 1-year planning envelope | Basis |
|---|---:|---|
| `products` | 10,000 | Explicit SRS NFR |
| `users` | 50,000 | Conservative planning assumption |
| `orders` | 100,000 | Conservative V1 envelope |
| `order_items` | 300,000 | Assumes ~3 lines/order |
| `downloads` | 2,000,000 | Unlimited-download product requires a high envelope |
| `notifications` | 1,500,000 | Multiple lifecycle notifications per active customer |
| `email_outbox` | 1,000,000 | Transactional mail across auth/orders/offers |
| `audit_logs` | 5,000,000 | Highest expected append-only table |

### Largest-Table Decision

For T9, the planned largest table at 1 year is:

```text
audit_logs ≈ 5,000,000 rows
```

followed by:

```text
downloads ≈ 2,000,000 rows
```

Both already use monthly partitioning/retention strategies where appropriate.

### Review Trigger

Re-run capacity/index review if any table reaches **50% of its 1-year envelope earlier than month 6**, or if p95 latency misses the approved NFR.

# 28. T9 ERD / Schema Review Checklist

## Keys and Relationships

- [x] Every entity has a primary key strategy.
- [x] Foreign keys are identified.
- [x] `ON DELETE` behavior is defined by relationship category.
- [x] Business-history relationships use restrictive preservation semantics.
- [x] Category deletion is blocked while products are assigned.

## Nullability

- [x] `NOT NULL` is the default.
- [x] Nullable fields have named reasons.
- [x] Delivery address fields are conditionally required.

- [x] Product/category slug uniqueness is defined.
- [x] Webhook idempotency uniqueness is defined.
- [x] Product physical/STL type integrity is defined.
- [x] Order total arithmetic is defined.
- [x] V1 tax = 0 and currency = USD are defined.

## Time and Money

- [x] `TIMESTAMPTZ`/UTC throughout.
- [x] Integer cents used for money.
- [x] Currency stored explicitly.

## Deletion / Retention

- [x] Strategy documented per table/category.
- [x] Account anonymisation preserved.
- [x] Download retention and aggregation documented.
- [x] Audit partition/archive documented.
- [x] Attachment expiry documented.
- [x] Soft-delete vs explicit purge tension resolved: business records soft-delete/anonymise; explicit retention-managed records may purge.

## Indexes / Query Paths

- [x] Catalogue browse index.
- [x] Faceted filter index.
- [x] Rating/newest indexes.
- [x] Full-text/trigram search indexes.
- [x] Customer order-history index.
- [x] Admin order-queue index.
- [x] Fulfillment queue index.
- [x] Active-entitlement index.
- [x] Offer expiry index.
- [x] Email outbox index.
- [x] Payment reconciliation index.
- [x] Refund obligation index.
- [x] Retention-job indexes.

## Scale

- [x] Catalogue target: 10,000 products.
- [x] Concurrent-user target: 200.
- [x] Downloads/audit logs partitioned.
- [x] 1-year capacity envelopes written; planned largest table = `audit_logs` (~5M rows).

## Schema-Freeze Decisions — Resolved

1. **Shipping zones:** explicit active-zone selection at checkout; server resolves trusted rate; no geographic mapping table in V1.
2. **Capacity:** 1-year planning envelopes recorded; largest planned table is `audit_logs` (~5M), followed by `downloads` (~2M).
3. **Implementation enums:** exact V1 values frozen in §3.14.
4. **Wishlist removal:** soft delete with partial unique active-row constraint.
5. **Refresh-token reuse:** session-level `token_version` + hash rotation + reuse detection; no separate token-history table.
6. **Soft-delete tension:** explicit retention-managed data may physically purge; core business history uses soft delete/anonymisation/retention.

**Step 12 schema freeze: COMPLETE.**

---

# 29. Do Not Add to V1 Schema Without a New Requirement

The following are deliberately absent:

- stock quantity;
- product variants;
- subcategories;
- multi-vendor ownership;
- international shipping model;
- courier tracking;
- cash-on-delivery model;
- guest checkout/order customer snapshots for anonymous users;
- product comments;
- STL licensing management;
- tax/VAT engine;
- recommendation-engine tables;
- ERP integration tables.

If one of these is introduced later, update requirements/ERD/database design first, then create the migration.

# 30. Step 12 Completion Record

**Status: COMPLETE — V1 DATABASE SCHEMA DESIGN FROZEN**

## What may still change later

Normal future changes such as Whish provider details, real courier prices, token lifetimes, or actual production-volume estimates are **configuration/integration tuning**, not blockers to the V1 database schema. If a future requirement changes the data model, update this document/ERD first and then create an Alembic migration.

## Next Step

Proceed to **Step 13 — API / Interface Design**.
