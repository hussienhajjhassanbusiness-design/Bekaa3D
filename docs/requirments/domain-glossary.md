| **Storage Provider**            | The infrastructure abstraction responsible for private and public file persistence.                                                                                            | Digital Asset or database repository                                    |
| **Payment Provider Port**       | The application-facing interface for creating, querying, verifying, and refunding provider payments.                                                                           | Whish-specific implementation                                           |
| **Repository**                  | An application interface responsible for loading and persisting domain aggregates.                                                                                             | Service, API router, generic utility module                             |
| **Bounded Context**             | A business module that owns its domain concepts and persistence and is accessed by other contexts through explicit interfaces.                                                 | Microservice or arbitrary folder                                        |
| **Aggregate**                   | A consistency boundary whose related changes are controlled through one domain entry point and transaction.                                                                    | Database table or bounded context                                       |

## Canonical naming rules

### 1. Use one canonical noun

Use:

* `Cart`, not basket or pending order
* `Order`, not sale, purchase record, or checkout
* `OrderItem`, not order product, detail, or line product
* `Payment`, not transaction when referring to the internal payment entity
* `Refund`, not reimbursement record
* `Entitlement`, not license, ownership flag, or download permission
* `Offer`, not bid, proposal, or discount request
* `CustomRequest`, not idea order or custom order
* `Notification`, not message when referring to the in-app notification entity

### 2. Keep roles separate from persisted entities

`User` is the persisted account entity.

`Verified Customer` and `Administrator` are roles or capabilities associated with a User. Do not create a separate Customer entity unless the domain model is deliberately changed.

Recommended examples:

```python
class User: ...


class UserRole(StrEnum):
    CUSTOMER = "customer"
    ADMIN = "admin"
```

Avoid:

```python
class User: ...


class Customer: ...


class AdminUser: ...
```

unless they truly become separate domain entities with different identity lifecycles.

### 3. Use product type and purchase mode correctly

```python
class ProductType(StrEnum):
    PHYSICAL = "physical"
    STL = "stl"


class PurchaseMode(StrEnum):
    ONLINE_ONLY = "online_only"
    WHATSAPP_ONLY = "whatsapp_only"
    BOTH = "both"
```

`ProductType` answers **what the product is**.

`PurchaseMode` answers **how a physical product may be purchased**.

`FulfillmentMethod` answers **how a physical order is handed to the customer**.

```python
class FulfillmentMethod(StrEnum):
    DELIVERY = "delivery"
    PICKUP = "pickup"
```

These three concepts must never share one enum or database column.

### 4. Distinguish current data from snapshots

Use explicit snapshot names on order records:

```text
product_name_snapshot
unit_price_cents
image_url_snapshot
shipping_zone_name_snapshot
shipping_fee_cents
address_snapshot
lead_time_days_snapshot
batch_size_snapshot
```

Do not name an immutable order-time value simply `product_name`, `price`, or `address` when it could be confused with current catalogue or profile data.

### 5. Distinguish order status from item status

Use:

```text
order.status
order_item.fulfillment_status
payment.status
refund.status
offer.status
```

Do not use one generic `status` value across contexts without the owning entity being clear.

An Order’s status is a derived projection. Order-item, Payment, Refund, and Offer statuses are their own authoritative state machines.

### 6. Distinguish callbacks from verification

Use:

```text
WebhookEvent
receive_webhook()
verify_payment()
reconcile_payment()
confirm_payment_manually()
```

Never name the webhook receiver:

```text
confirm_payment()
mark_as_paid()
complete_payment()
```

Receiving a callback does not confirm payment.

### 7. Distinguish ownership from downloading

Use:

```text
Entitlement
Download
DownloadLog
```

An Entitlement authorizes access.

A Download is one transfer attempt.

A Download Log records that attempt.

An Order Item proves what was purchased but is not itself the download authorization authority.

### 8. Distinguish cancellation, refund, and return

* **Cancellation** stops eligible fulfillment.
* **Refund** records money to be returned.
* **Refund Settlement** confirms that money was returned.
* **Return** records a physical item coming back after shipment or delivery.

One action may lead to another, but they are not synonyms.

### 9. Use database names that match the glossary

Recommended table names:

```text
users
addresses
sessions
verification_tokens
password_reset_tokens

products
product_images
categories
materials
colours

carts
cart_items
orders
order_items
order_status_history

payments
webhook_events
refunds
refund_items

asset_versions
stl_assets
entitlements
downloads
download_stats_monthly

shipping_zones

offers
offer_rounds

reviews
wishlist_items
notifications
custom_requests
custom_request_attachments
contact_messages

settings
audit_logs
email_outbox
idempotency_records
```

Do not mix naming styles such as `order_details`, `payment_transactions`, `download_permissions`, or `idea_orders` unless the glossary is formally changed first.

### 10. Use API routes that expose the same vocabulary

Recommended route nouns:

```text
/products
/cart
/cart/items
/checkout
/orders
/orders/{order_id}/items
/payments
/payment-webhooks
/refunds
/entitlements
/downloads
/offers
/reviews
/wishlist
/notifications
/custom-requests
/contact-messages
/shipping-zones
/settings
/audit-logs
```

Avoid alternate route nouns such as:

```text
/basket
/sales
/purchases
/bids
/licenses
/files-owned
/idea-orders
```

### 11. Treat term changes as domain changes

Changing a canonical term requires updating:

* Glossary
* SRS and functional requirements
* Python domain and application names
* Database migrations
* API contracts
* Tests
* Documentation
* Analytics labels

A term must not be renamed in only one layer.
