# Bekaa3D — API Endpoint Contract

**Document:** `api-endpoints.md`  
**Step:** 13 — API / Interface Design  
**Status:** V1 endpoint structure complete; ready for schema/OpenAPI implementation review  
**Source of truth:** `Bekaa3D_SRS_Complete.md` + frozen V1 `database-design.md`  
**Base API:** `/api/v1`

> **Important source rule:** The approved SRS names the required endpoint groups, features, security boundaries, state machines, and API conventions, but it does not prescribe every individual URL or Pydantic schema name. Exact paths, schema names, and a small number of low-level interaction details in this document are **V1 API design decisions**. They do not change the business requirements.

---

# 1. Contract Principles

1. Public and customer APIs live under `/api/v1`.
2. Admin APIs live under the separate `/api/v1/admin` router.
3. Payment-provider callbacks live under `/api/v1/webhooks`.
4. Operational health endpoints live outside the versioned business API.
5. The client never supplies trusted prices, totals, shipping rates, verified-purchase flags, entitlement state, order status projections, or payment-confirmed state.
6. Every authenticated resource fetch by ID performs object-level authorization.
7. A caller who is authenticated but not allowed to know that a resource exists receives `404 NOT_FOUND`, not an existence-revealing `403`.
8. Every write by a normal account requires a verified email, except identity flows and explicitly public guest forms.
9. Every unsafe cookie-authenticated request uses CSRF protection.
10. Every collection endpoint is bounded either by cursor pagination or an explicit hard limit.
11. All externally visible errors use stable machine-readable codes.
12. State-machine mutations use explicit action/transition endpoints rather than unrestricted status-field PATCHes.
13. Side effects such as email delivery are committed via the transactional outbox and executed after commit.
14. Whish callbacks are notifications only; they never directly prove payment.
15. STL bytes are never streamed through FastAPI; the API authorizes and nginx serves via internal redirect.

# 2. Global API Conventions

| Concern | V1 Contract |
|---|---|
| Base path | `/api/v1` |
| Authentication | httpOnly, Secure, SameSite cookies |
| Access token | Short lived |
| Refresh token | Rotating; stored hashed server-side |
| CSRF | Double-submit token on unsafe cookie-authenticated methods |
| CSRF header | `X-CSRF-Token` |
| Dates | ISO-8601 UTC |
| Money | `{"amount_cents": 1999, "currency": "USD"}` |
| Enums | lowercase snake-case strings |
| Errors | RFC 9457 `application/problem+json` |
| Pagination | cursor-based |
| Page parameters | `cursor`, `limit` |
| Default page size | 20 — V1 API design decision |
| Maximum page size | 100 — V1 API design decision |
| Sorting | comma-separated fields; `-` prefix means descending |
| Filtering | allowlisted query parameters only |
| Idempotency | `Idempotency-Key` required on normal checkout, offer checkout, and refund creation |
| Rate limits | `RateLimit-*` response headers |
| Request correlation | response/problem includes stable `request_id` |
| Empty collection | `"items": []` |
| Unknown JSON fields | rejected on input schemas (`extra="forbid"`) |

## 2.1 Standard Cursor Page

```json
{
  "items": [],
  "next_cursor": null
}
```

`next_cursor = null` means there is no next page.

## 2.2 Stable Sorting

Every cursor-paginated query appends a deterministic unique tie-breaker internally, normally `id`, even when the caller sorts by another field.

Example:

```text
sort=-created_at
```

is internally equivalent to a stable ordering such as:

```text
created_at DESC, id DESC
```

The client does not construct or interpret cursors.

# 3. Authentication Levels

| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Public** | No login required |
| **Authenticated** | Valid session; email verification not required for read-only account operations |
| **Verified Customer** | Authenticated + verified email |
| **Admin + MFA** | Administrator session with MFA completed |
| **Provider** | External payment-provider request; no cookie auth |
| **System** | Internal worker/scheduler; not exposed as a public HTTP endpoint |

### Admin Information-Hiding Rule

- no authentication → `401 AUTH_REQUIRED`;
- authenticated non-admin calling an admin route → `404 NOT_FOUND`;
- admin without completed MFA → `401 MFA_REQUIRED`.

The last case arises only for an administrator whose MFA enrollment is not yet
confirmed. Login is MFA-gated (§8.1, §8.2 and
[ADR-017](../adr/ADR-017-login-gated-admin-mfa.md)): an administrator with an
enabled credential receives `202 MfaChallengeRead` and no session at all, so
they cannot reach an admin route to be challenged. No challenge is issued by
the admin boundary — the only source of one is `POST /auth/login`.

---

# 4. CSRF and Cookie Behaviour

1. Login/refresh sets or rotates the readable CSRF cookie used by the double-submit pattern.
2. Authenticated unsafe methods send the matching value in `X-CSRF-Token`.
3. Webhook endpoints do **not** use browser CSRF; they use provider/IP/signature controls.
4. Public guest forms do not rely on auth cookies and use captcha + rate limiting.
5. Logout clears auth cookies and revokes the current server-side session.

---

# 5. Error Contract

All API errors return `application/problem+json`.

Recommended shape:

```json
{
  "type": "https://bekaa3d.example/problems/PRODUCT_NOT_PURCHASABLE",
  "title": "Request cannot be completed",
  "status": 422,
  "detail": "Human-readable diagnostic text.",
  "instance": "/api/v1/checkout",
  "code": "PRODUCT_NOT_PURCHASABLE",
  "request_id": "req_...",
  "errors": []
}
```

The frontend renders its own message from `code`; `detail` is a diagnostic string, not user-facing copy.

## 5.1 SRS-Defined Stable Errors

| Status | Code | Meaning |
|---:|---|---|
| 400 | `MALFORMED_REQUEST` | Body cannot be parsed |
| 401 | `AUTH_REQUIRED` | No valid authentication |
| 403 | `EMAIL_VERIFICATION_REQUIRED` | Write attempted by unverified account |
| 404 | `NOT_FOUND` | Missing resource or intentionally hidden unauthorized resource |
| 409 | `PRODUCT_ALREADY_OWNED` | Active STL entitlement exists |
| 409 | `OFFER_ALREADY_ACTIVE` | Live offer already exists |
| 409 | `IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_CONFLICT` | Same key reused with a different request body |
| 410 | `OFFER_CHECKOUT_EXPIRED` | Accepted-offer checkout window elapsed |
| 422 | `QUANTITY_EXCEEDS_LIMIT` | Quantity exceeds product cap |
| 422 | `OFFER_BELOW_MINIMUM` | Offer below configured floor |
| 422 | `PRODUCT_NOT_PURCHASABLE` | Product cannot currently be bought online |
| 422 | `OFFER_COOLDOWN_ACTIVE` | Rejection cooldown active |
| 429 | `RATE_LIMITED` | Rate limit exceeded |
| 503 | `ORDERS_PAUSED` | Global checkout kill switch enabled |

## 5.2 Additional V1 Contract Errors

These codes are implementation additions needed to give the frontend deterministic handling for required SRS behaviours.

| Status | Code | Meaning |
|---:|---|---|
| 422 | `VALIDATION_ERROR` | Parsed body violates schema |
| 400 | `INVALID_TOKEN` | Verification/reset token invalid |
| 401 | `INVALID_CREDENTIALS` | Login failed; response remains enumeration-safe |
| 401 | `MFA_REQUIRED` | Admin login requires second factor |
| 401 | `MFA_INVALID` | MFA code/recovery code invalid |
| 403 | `ACCOUNT_DISABLED` | Account cannot authenticate/write |
| 403 | `CSRF_INVALID` | CSRF token missing/mismatch |
| 409 | `ACCOUNT_DELETION_BLOCKED` | Open order or unsettled refund prevents anonymisation |
| 409 | `CART_EMPTY` | Checkout attempted with no valid lines |
| 409 | `CART_PRICE_CHANGED` | Current product price differs from unconfirmed cart snapshot |
| 409 | `INVALID_STATE_TRANSITION` | Requested state-machine transition is illegal |
| 409 | `ORDER_NOT_CANCELLABLE` | Customer/admin cancellation cannot legally occur |
| 409 | `PAYMENT_ALREADY_ACTIVE` | Live payment already exists |
| 409 | `CATEGORY_IN_USE` | Category cannot be archived while products remain assigned |
| 409 | `SLUG_CONFLICT` | Live slug already exists |
| 409 | `REVIEW_ALREADY_EXISTS` | Active user/product review already exists |
| 409 | `OFFER_NOT_YOUR_TURN` | Offer action attempted by wrong actor |
| 409 | `ASSET_SCAN_PENDING` | Asset bundle not yet safe to publish |
| 410 | `OFFER_EXPIRED` | Offer inactivity lifetime elapsed |
| 410 | `RESOURCE_EXPIRED` | Single-use/time-limited resource expired |
| 416 | `RANGE_NOT_SATISFIABLE` | Invalid download byte range |
| 422 | `REFUND_EXCEEDS_AVAILABLE` | Requested refund exceeds refundable amount |
| 422 | `INVALID_FULFILLMENT` | Address/zone/method does not match cart contents |
| 422 | `UPLOAD_REJECTED` | Type/size/count/content validation failed |
| 422 | `MALWARE_DETECTED` | Uploaded content failed malware scan |
| 422 | `SETTING_INVALID` | Setting value does not match its declared type/range |
| 429 | `DOWNLOAD_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` | Daily abuse cap exceeded |
| 502 | `PAYMENT_PROVIDER_ERROR` | Provider call failed |
| 503 | `PAYMENT_VERIFICATION_UNAVAILABLE` | Automated verification unavailable and manual verification is required |

**Security note:** authentication, resend-verification, and password-reset flows must preserve the SRS anti-enumeration requirement. Do not leak account existence through response body, timing, or status differences.

# 6. Operational Endpoints

These are intentionally outside `/api/v1`.

| Method + Path | Auth / Authorization | Request | Success | Errors | Pagination / Filter / Sort | Side Effects / Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /health/live` | Public | — | `200 LivenessRead` | 503 | — | Process liveness only; no deep dependency probing |
| `GET /health/ready` | Public/infra | — | `200 ReadinessRead` | 503 | — | Checks required dependencies; includes app version/commit, never secrets |

---

# 7. Public Storefront Endpoints

## 7.1 Catalogue and Search

| Method + Path | Auth / Authorization | Request | Success | Errors | Pagination / Filter / Sort | Side Effects / Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/v1/products` | Public | query params | `200 ProductPage` | 400, 429 | Cursor; filters: `type`, `category_id`, `material_id`, `colour_id`, `price_min_cents`, `price_max_cents`, `min_rating`, `featured`, `q`; sorts: `price`, `-price`, `-average_rating`, `-created_at`, `-download_count` | Only non-deleted, visible products in active categories; unavailable products remain visible |
| `GET /api/v1/products/{slug}` | Public | — | `200 ProductDetail` | 404, 429 | — | Response includes relevant commerce capabilities and SEO fields |
| `GET /api/v1/products/{slug}/reviews` | Public | query params | `200 ReviewPage` | 404, 429 | Cursor; optional `rating`, `verified_purchase`; sort `-created_at` default | Hidden/deleted reviews excluded |
| `GET /api/v1/search/suggestions` | Public | `q`, `limit` | `200 SearchSuggestionList` | 400, 429 | Hard limit; V1 max 10 | Trigram typo tolerance |
| `GET /api/v1/categories` | Public | — | `200 CategoryList` | 429 | Hard-limited reference list | Active categories only |
| `GET /api/v1/materials` | Public | — | `200 MaterialList` | 429 | Hard-limited reference list | Active material values |
| `GET /api/v1/colours` | Public | — | `200 ColourList` | 429 | Hard-limited reference list | Active colour values |
| `GET /api/v1/settings/public` | Public | — | `200 PublicSettingsRead` | 429 | — | Strict allowlist only; e.g. WhatsApp number, pickup address/hours, accepting-orders state, free-shipping threshold |

### Public Product List Rules

- facets combine with logical AND;
- `q` searches translated product name/description;
- `material_id` and `colour_id` apply only where meaningful;
- `-download_count` is valid for STL products;
- server may reject nonsensical sort/filter combinations with `400 VALIDATION_ERROR`;
- `limit` is bounded by the global maximum.

## 7.2 Guest Lead / Contact Forms

| Method + Path | Auth / Authorization | Request | Success | Errors | Pagination / Filter / Sort | Side Effects / Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

# 8. Authentication and MFA Endpoints

## 8.1 Core Authentication

| Method + Path | Auth / Authorization | Request | Success | Errors | Side Effects / Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/v1/auth/register` | Public | `RegisterRequest` | `202 RegistrationAccepted` | 400, 422, 429 | **Enumeration-safe:** same response whether address is new or already registered; if eligible, creates unverified account and enqueues verification email |
| `POST /api/v1/auth/login` | Public | `LoginRequest` | Customer: `200 SessionRead`; Admin needing MFA: `202 MfaChallengeRead` | 400, 401, 403, 429 | Progressive delay/lockout; successful customer login sets auth + CSRF cookies |
| `POST /api/v1/auth/logout` | Authenticated | — | `204` | 401, 403 CSRF | Revokes current session; clears cookies |
| `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh` | Authenticated refresh cookie | — | `204` | 401, 403 CSRF, 429 | Rotates refresh token/hash/version and CSRF cookie; detects token reuse |
| `POST /api/v1/auth/verify-email` | Public | `VerifyEmailRequest` | `204` | 400 `INVALID_TOKEN`, 410 `RESOURCE_EXPIRED`, 429 | Single-use token; audits account event |
| `POST /api/v1/auth/resend-verification` | Public or authenticated | `ResendVerificationRequest` | `202` | 429 | Uniform response regardless of account existence/state; outbox email if eligible |
| `POST /api/v1/auth/password-reset/request` | Public | `PasswordResetRequest` | `202` | 429 | Uniform response; enqueue reset email only when appropriate |
| `POST /api/v1/auth/password-reset/confirm` | Public | `PasswordResetConfirm` | `204` | 400, 410, 429 | Replaces password hash; revokes all sessions; audits security event |

## 8.2 Admin MFA

**V1 API design assumption:** TOTP is used for the administrator because the SRS requires admin MFA but does not name a mechanism.

Persistence is defined in Step 12 by `mfa_credentials` and one-time hashed `mfa_recovery_codes`.

| Method + Path | Auth / Authorization | Request | Success | Errors | Side Effects / Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/v1/auth/mfa/setup` | Authenticated admin enrollment session | `MfaSetupRequest` | `200 MfaSetupRead` | 401, 404, 429 | Returns TOTP setup material once; secret remains protected |
| `POST /api/v1/auth/mfa/setup/confirm` | Authenticated admin enrollment session | `MfaSetupConfirmRequest` | `200 MfaRecoveryCodesRead` | 401, 422, 429 | Enables MFA only after valid code; returns one-time recovery codes |
| `POST /api/v1/auth/mfa/verify` | MFA challenge | `MfaVerifyRequest` | `204` | 401 `MFA_INVALID`, 410, 429 | Completes admin login; sets full auth + CSRF cookies |
| `POST /api/v1/auth/mfa/recovery-codes/regenerate` | Admin + MFA | `MfaRecoveryRegenerateRequest` | `200 MfaRecoveryCodesRead` | 401, 404, 429 | Invalidates previous recovery codes; audit event |

### Registration Anti-Enumeration Behaviour

Registration never returns a distinguishable `EMAIL_ALREADY_REGISTERED` error.

- new email → create unverified account + queue verification email;
- existing unverified email → may queue/resend verification subject to rate limits;
- existing verified email → no account mutation; optional security notification;
- all cases return the same public `202 RegistrationAccepted` shape.

This follows SEC-06 and prevents registration from becoming an account-existence oracle.

There is no normal “disable MFA” endpoint in V1 because the SRS treats admin MFA as required.

# 9. Customer Account Endpoints

## 9.1 Profile and Data Rights

| Method + Path | Auth / Authorization | Request | Success | Errors | Pagination / Filter / Sort | Side Effects / Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/v1/me` | Authenticated | — | `200 UserProfileRead` | 401 | — | Read allowed while unverified; no V1 mutable profile field exists, so there is no corresponding write endpoint |
| `GET /api/v1/me/export` | Verified Customer | — | `200 DataExportRead` | 401, 403, 429 | — | JSON export includes profile, addresses, orders, downloads, reviews, offers |
| `DELETE /api/v1/me` | Verified Customer; fresh-auth requirement | `AccountDeletionRequest` | `204` | 401, 403, 409 `ACCOUNT_DELETION_BLOCKED`, 429 | — | Anonymises; blocked by open orders/unsettled refunds; disables login |

`ACCOUNT_DELETION_BLOCKED` is an additional stable V1 code.

## 9.2 Address Book

| Method + Path | Auth / Authorization | Request | Success | Errors | Pagination | Side Effects / Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/v1/me/addresses` | Authenticated | — | `200 AddressList` | 401 | Hard-limited | Own addresses only |
| `POST /api/v1/me/addresses` | Verified Customer | `AddressCreate` | `201 AddressRead` | 401, 403, 422 | — | Setting default clears prior default atomically |
| `GET /api/v1/me/addresses/{address_id}` | Authenticated; owner | — | `200 AddressRead` | 401, 404 | — | Object ownership |
| `PATCH /api/v1/me/addresses/{address_id}` | Verified Customer; owner | `AddressUpdate` | `200 AddressRead` | 401, 403, 404, 422 | — | Historical orders unaffected because they use snapshots |
| `DELETE /api/v1/me/addresses/{address_id}` | Verified Customer; owner | — | `204` | 401, 403, 404, 409 | — | Soft delete; reject deletion when needed by an in-progress checkout/order workflow |
| `PUT /api/v1/me/addresses/{address_id}/default` | Verified Customer; owner | — | `200 AddressRead` | 401, 403, 404 | — | Atomically switches default |

# 10. Cart, Shipping and Checkout

## 10.1 Cart

| Method + Path | Auth / Authorization | Request | Success | Errors | Pagination / Filter / Sort | Side Effects / Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/v1/cart` | Authenticated | — | `200 CartRead` | 401 | — | Shows snapshot price + current price + `price_changed`; may include fulfillment-relevant summary |
| `POST /api/v1/cart/items` | Verified Customer | `CartItemAdd` | `200 CartRead` | 401, 403, 409 `PRODUCT_ALREADY_OWNED`, 422 `PRODUCT_NOT_PURCHASABLE` / `QUANTITY_EXCEEDS_LIMIT`, 429 | — | Existing product merges quantity; STL quantity forced to 1 |
| `PATCH /api/v1/cart/items/{product_id}` | Verified Customer | `CartItemQuantityUpdate` | `200 CartRead` | 401, 403, 404, 422, 429 | — | Sets absolute physical quantity; STL remains exactly 1 |
| `DELETE /api/v1/cart/items/{product_id}` | Verified Customer | — | `204` | 401, 403, 404 | — | Removes current cart line |

## 10.2 Shipping Zones

| Method + Path | Auth / Authorization | Request | Success | Errors | Pagination | Side Effects / Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/v1/shipping-zones` | Verified Customer | — | `200 ShippingZoneList` | 401, 403 | Hard-limited | Active Lebanese zones/rates only; server remains rate authority |

V1 uses explicit zone selection. No automatic governorate→zone mapping endpoint exists.

## 10.3 Checkout

| Method + Path | Auth / Authorization | Request | Success | Errors | Side Effects / Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/v1/checkout` | Verified Customer | `CheckoutRequest` + required `Idempotency-Key` | `201 CheckoutRead` | 401, 403, 409 `CART_EMPTY` / `CART_PRICE_CHANGED` / `IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_CONFLICT` / `PAYMENT_ALREADY_ACTIVE`, 422 `INVALID_FULFILLMENT` / `PRODUCT_NOT_PURCHASABLE` / `QUANTITY_EXCEEDS_LIMIT`, 429, 503 `ORDERS_PAUSED`, 502 | Single transaction validates cart, recomputes amounts, snapshots order/lines/address/shipping/terms, creates pending payment, clears cart; returns provider redirect information |

### Price-Change Confirmation Contract

`CartRead` exposes old snapshot and current price.

When checkout detects a change not explicitly accepted:

```text
409 CART_PRICE_CHANGED
```

with a problem extension:

```json
{
  "price_changes": [
    {
      "product_id": "...",
      "old_amount_cents": 1000,
      "new_amount_cents": 1200,
      "currency": "USD"
    }
  ]
}
```

The retry includes exact accepted values in `CheckoutRequest.accepted_price_changes`.

If a price changes again after the user confirms, the request fails again rather than silently charging a new amount.

A materially changed retry uses a **new** idempotency key.

# 15. Admin Catalogue Endpoints

All routes in this section require **Admin + MFA**. All mutations are audit-logged.

The line-transition endpoint is the only normal API path for fulfillment status changes.

# 27. Admin Analytics Endpoints

All analytics are read-only, Admin + MFA, bounded by explicit date ranges/limits. Revenue is attributed **per order line**, not per order.

| Method + Path | Request / Query | Success | Errors | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/v1/admin/analytics/overview` | optional date range | `200 AnalyticsOverview` | 401/404, 400 | Pending offers count, high-level customer/order metrics |

---

## 29.5 Checkout

### `CheckoutRequest`

```text
fulfillment_method?: "delivery" | "pickup"
address_id?: UUID
shipping_zone_id?: UUID
customer_note?: str
accept_terms: true
accept_digital_final_sale?: true
accepted_price_changes?: [
  {
    product_id: UUID,

    currency: "USD"
  }
]
```

Rules:

- digital-only → fulfillment/address/zone are null;
- physical delivery → fulfillment=`delivery`, address + zone required;
- physical pickup → fulfillment=`pickup`, no address/zone needed;

## 29.10 Admin Product

### `AdminProductCreate`

```text
type: "physical" | "stl"
category_id: UUID
name: str
description?: str
slug: str
seo_title?: str
seo_description?: str
og_image_url?: str
price: {amount_cents, currency="USD"}
is_visible?: bool
is_featured?: bool
is_available?: bool

# physical only
purchase_mode?
material_id?
colour_id?
dimensions?
production_lead_time_days?
batch_size?
max_quantity_per_line?
weight_grams?
```

Name is required. Server regenerates the search vector from name/description on write.

### `AdminProductUpdate`

Same mutable fields are optional **except `type`**. Product type is immutable after creation in V1; converting a physical product into an STL product (or vice versa) requires creating a new product rather than corrupting type-specific history.

---

## 29.11 Images / STL Assets

### `ProductImageUpload` — multipart

```text
file
alt_text?
```

### `ProductImageUpdate`

```text
alt_text?

`MaterialCreate`, `ColourCreate`:

```text
name: str
is_active?: bool
```

### `ShippingZoneCreate`

```text
name: str
rate: {amount_cents, currency="USD"}
is_active?: bool
```

### `ShippingZoneUpdate`

Same fields optional.

---

## 29.13 Refund

### `RefundCreate`

```text
items: [
  {
    order_item_id: UUID,
    amount_cents: int
  }
]
shipping_refund_cents?: int
reason: str
method?: "provider" | "manual"
```

Rules:

- server derives currency;
- every amount is validated against remaining refundable value;
- overall refund total is derived server-side;
- digital refund triggers entitlement revocation;
- provider capability may force manual method.

### `RefundSettlementRequest`

```text
reference?: str
note?: str
```

Used only when manual/provider workflow reaches confirmed settlement.

---

## 29.14 Payment Manual Confirmation

### `ManualPaymentConfirmRequest`

```text
provider_reference: str
verified_amount_cents: int
evidence_note: str
```

Server requires exact order-total match and records the admin actor/audit trail.

---

## 29.15 Custom Request Admin

### `CustomRequestTransition`

```text
target_status: custom_request_status
quoted_amount_cents?: int
outcome?: "won" | "lost"
note?: str
```

Fields are allowed only when meaningful for the transition.

### `CustomRequestAdminUpdate`

```text
admin_notes?: str
```

---

## 29.16 Settings

### `SettingUpdate`

```text
value: JSON value
```

Server validates against the existing key's declared setting type/range.

# 33. Endpoints That Must **Not** Be Invented for V1

These SRS features do not require separate backend CRUD APIs:

| Feature | V1 Handling |
|---|---|
| Home hero / why-choose-us / footer | Frontend/static composition using public catalogue/settings data |
| About Us content/gallery | Frontend/static content unless a future CMS requirement is added |
| Floating WhatsApp button | Frontend uses allowlisted public WhatsApp setting |
| WhatsApp product contact | Frontend constructs link with product context; no order is created |
| Canonical markup | Frontend/server-rendering layer using product slugs |
| Product comments | Explicitly out of V1 |
| Product variants | Explicitly out of V1 |
| Courier tracking API | Explicitly out of V1 |
| Cash on delivery | Explicitly out of V1 |
| Guest checkout | Explicitly out of V1 |
| Tax/VAT engine | Explicitly out of V1 |
| STL licensing | Explicitly out of V1 |

## SEO Sitemap Note

The SRS requires per-language XML sitemaps but does not assign ownership to the backend API. This should be generated by the web/rendering layer from the product/category contract. Do **not** add mutable “sitemap CRUD” endpoints.

---

# 34. Internal Jobs — No Public Endpoint

These are scheduler/worker operations, not HTTP APIs:

```text
dispatch_outbox
expire_offers
release_stale_checkouts
reconcile_payments
purge_unverified_users
purge_expired_attachments
reap_orphan_files
backup_verify
ensure_partitions
prune_download_details
rotate_ip_salt
```

Admin manual reconcile/confirm endpoints exist for operational intervention, but the scheduled jobs themselves are not exposed as public “run job” routes.

---

# 35. Feature-to-Endpoint Traceability

# 36. Security Review by Route Class

## Public Reads

- rate-limit expensive search/autocomplete;
- parameterized FTS/trigram queries;
- no deleted/invisible product leakage.

## Public Forms

- captcha;
- rate limits by IP/email;
- upload type inspection;
- image re-encoding;
- malware scanning;
- private storage.

## Customer Writes

- authenticated cookie;
- verified email;
- CSRF;
- ownership;
- object IDs never substitute for authorization.

## Downloads

- verified customer;
- active entitlement;
- daily cap;
- salted IP hash;
- no public storage path;
- Range support delegated to nginx after authorization.

## Admin

- separate router;
- MFA;
- non-admin existence hiding;
- audit every mutation;
- least PII in logs.

## Payment Webhook

- IP allowlist when possible;
- signature verification when provider supports it;
- unique provider event ID;
- immediate persistence;
- independent server-side verification before granting anything.

# 37. Open External Details That Do Not Change Route Structure

The approved SRS still waits on Whish/client/operations details. These do not block the endpoint structure:

- Whish signature mechanism;
- Whish status-query capability;
- provider refund API vs manual transfer;
- sandbox availability;
- exact transaction settlement/fees;
- actual courier partner/rates;
- pickup identity policy;
- terms/privacy/refund wording;
- exact session/token lifetimes;
- BYI attachment retention period;
- analytics default date ranges/export formats.

When these values become known, update provider adapters, settings, validation, and possibly request/response detail—not the fundamental endpoint grouping.
