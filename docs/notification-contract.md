# The notification contract

How in-app notifications are typed, shaped, owned and read. Introduced by
VS-008; the endpoints are `GET /api/v1/me/notifications` and
`PATCH /api/v1/me/notifications/{notification_id}`.

VS-008 builds the **channel**. It deliberately ships no production event
semantics — the slices that own orders, payments, offers, refunds and downloads
define those when they are built.

## Type: a stable high-level category

`notification_type` is a PostgreSQL enum with exactly six values, from
`database-design.md` §12.3:

```
account   order   payment   refund   offer   download
```

The design is explicit that this enum stays a *category*: "The specific event is
carried in the JSON payload; the enum remains a stable high-level category."

That split is load-bearing. A new business event needs a new `payload.event`
value and no migration; a new *category* is a schema change, because adding a
value to a PostgreSQL enum is DDL. The friction is intentional and sits in the
right place.

## Payload

The payload is **supporting presentation data, not the source of truth** for
orders or payments. Never read it to decide anything; read the owning context's
tables through their service interfaces.

Rules enforced by `app.engagement.domain.payload`:

| Rule | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Must be a JSON object | Not an array, string or number. Keys must be strings. |
| Must contain `event` | A non-empty string. |
| `event` values are open in V1 | No enum, no registry. Producer slices define them. |
| Maximum 16 KiB | Measured after deterministic compact UTF-8 serialisation. |
| No secrets or sensitive data | FR-17: "Sensitive data must not be exposed in notification payloads." |

### On `event`

`payload["event"]` is the discriminator the database design refers to. VS-008
requires the key to *exist* and forbids nothing about its value.

Requiring it now rather than later is deliberate: it stops the first two
producing slices inventing two different conventions, and adding a required
field to an already-populated table means a backfill. Tests use neutral values
such as `account.test`.

### On the 16 KiB ceiling

**A V1 technical safety limit, not an SRS-defined business value.** Nothing in
the specification names a payload size. It exists so that a defect in a future
producing slice cannot write a multi-megabyte JSONB row that then has to be read
back on every page of the notification list. Revisit it if a real payload ever
approaches it — no current one comes close.

Size is measured on a compact, key-sorted, UTF-8 serialisation, so two payloads
differing only in key order cannot land on opposite sides of the limit.

### On sensitive data

A payload is rendered in a browser and is readable by anyone who can dump the
table. An amount and an order reference are fine. A card reference, a token, a
password-reset link or a full address are not — those belong in the owning
context's table, behind that context's authorization.

## Read state

Persisted as a single nullable column, `read_at`:

```
read_at IS NULL      unread
read_at IS NOT NULL  read, at that moment
```

The API exposes a boolean `read`, and **not** `read_at`. `read` is derived on
every render from `read_at is not None`, so the two can never drift — which a
stored boolean sitting beside a timestamp eventually would.

`read_at` keeps its **first-read** meaning. Marking an already-read notification
read again is a no-op on the timestamp (`COALESCE(read_at, now())`), so it
records when the customer first saw the notification, not when they last tapped
it. Marking unread sets it back to `NULL`; both directions are supported and
both are idempotent.

There is no `updated_at` column. `read_at` is the only mutable field, so a
second mutation timestamp would carry no information the first does not.

### Concurrency

Marking read is **idempotent state assignment**, not a read-modify-write. It
computes nothing from the previous value, writes no audit chain, and maintains
no invariant spanning rows — so it uses a single atomic `UPDATE` and
deliberately **no** `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`.

This is a real difference from VS-007's settings editor, which needs the row
lock because its audit trail must record a truthful `before → after` chain. Here
every interleaving of two concurrent calls leaves a legitimate state, and the
contract for simultaneous `read=true` / `read=false` is simply **last database
writer wins**. HTTP execution order is not guaranteed, so the final state is not
claimed to correspond to whichever click happened first in wall-clock time.

## Ownership

A user may view or mark only their own notifications.

Ownership is encoded in the SQL predicate — `WHERE id = ... AND user_id = ...` —
never by loading a row and comparing in Python. A filter that is part of the
query cannot be forgotten on one branch the way a later `if` can.

Zero rows returned means **`404 NOT_FOUND`**, identically for "no such
notification" and "someone else's notification". A `403` on the second case
would confirm the row exists and let a customer enumerate other people's
notification ids.

| Endpoint | Level | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /me/notifications` | Authenticated | Verification not required — reading is not a write. |
| `PATCH /me/notifications/{id}` | Verified Customer; owner | Plus CSRF, per SEC-03. |

An unverified account gets `403 EMAIL_VERIFICATION_REQUIRED` on the PATCH. The
`current_verified_user` dependency reads the user row rather than trusting the
access token's `ver` claim, so a customer who has just verified is not refused
for the remainder of that token's fifteen minutes.

## Creating notifications

`app.engagement.application.services.notification_writer.create_notification` is
the **only** sanctioned write path. It takes the caller's `AsyncSession` and
does not commit, so a notification lands in the same transaction as the business
event that caused it:

```
business mutation
create_notification(...)
email outbox insert, if the event also warrants email
COMMIT
```

If the payment rolls back, the notification announcing it rolls back with it.

Other bounded contexts must not import `NotificationModel`,
`NotificationRepository`, or write raw SQL against `notifications`.
`tests/unit/engagement/test_notification_boundary.py` enforces this.

There is no message broker, no event bus and no background notification worker.

## Notification vs EmailOutbox

Two different things that the glossary is careful to keep apart — a Notification
is "not an Email Outbox record", and an Email Outbox record is "not a
Notification".

| | Notification | EmailOutbox |
| --- | --- | --- |
| What it is | A durable, user-owned in-app record | A queue of email to an external provider |
| Lifecycle | `unread → read` | `pending → sending → sent / failed` |
| Machinery | None | Retry, backoff, attempt count, worker claiming |
| Context | Engagement | Platform |

Notification creation is **not** routed through the email outbox, and neither is
derived from the other. A business event that warrants both simply calls both
services inside the same transaction. Chaining them would let an email-provider
failure affect in-app state, which is precisely the coupling ADR-011 exists to
prevent.

To be accurate about what this does and does not guarantee: a notification
insert **can** fail, and it rolls its transaction back when it does. What it has
no separate lifecycle for is *external delivery* — once the transaction commits,
the notification is already where the customer will read it, because the
customer reads this table directly. Email leaves the system and therefore needs a
delivery lifecycle; an in-app notification does not.

## Retention

**Intentionally undecided.** `database-design.md` records the retention policy
for notifications as "not numerically specified", and
`entities-and-business-rules.md` asks for "soft deletion or retention-based
pruning **after a formal retention decision**."

No such decision exists, so VS-008 adds no pruning job, no `deleted_at` column
and no retention constant. Inventing a number here would be an unapproved
operational decision dressed up as an implementation detail.

The foreign key is `ON DELETE CASCADE`. Never-verified accounts are legitimately
physically purged (FR-02), `notifications.user_id` is `NOT NULL` so `SET NULL`
is not representable, and verified-customer deletion remains anonymisation
rather than deletion.
